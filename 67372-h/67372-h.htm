<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the light of morning touches the buildings
and pavements of a city, it always seems to borrow
their hardness and to lose in some degree its quality
of flowing detachment. The Sunday morning that fell
upon Ninth Avenue, New York City, gave you a sense
of invisible stiffness in its very air. The buildings,
with their smudged, flat fronts and tops, presented
the impression of huge warehouses stretching down
both sides of the street&mdash;the appearance of holding
commodities rather than human beings. Most of them
were five or six stories in height, and their curtained,
oblong windows and the bright, tawdry shops at their
base had an oddly lifeless aspect, in spite of the sounds
and animations which occurred within and around
them. The iron elevated-railroad structure that extended
down the street, with all of its roar and rush of
trains, could not destroy the spirit of silent inertia
that lurked within the scene.</p>

<p>Blanche Palmer stood in front of a bureau, in one
of the apartments that lined the street, and combed
her dark red, bobbed hair, as though it were a sacred
and perilous performance. She was only partially
dressed, and the mild light that came in through a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
rear window from the courtyard brought an extra
vividness to her semiplump arms, abruptly rounded
shoulders and moderately swelling bosom. Their
freshness stood out, a little forlorn and challenging,
in the disordered room with its half drab and half
gaudy arrangements. The brass bed, the magazine-posters
of pretty women against the pink-flowered
wallpaper, the red plush chair with the most infinitely
smug of shapes, the white chintz, half-dirty curtain
and dark green shade at the window&mdash;all of them
seemed to be meanly contending against the youth and
life of her body.</p>

<p>She was fairly tall, with most of the weight of her
body centered below her waist and with an incongruously
small torso, but this effect was not as clumsy
as it might have been, since it was relieved by a bold
approach to symmetry. Something of a child and an
amazon met in her body. Her face was not pretty if
you examined each of its features separately&mdash;the
overwide lips, the nose tilting out too suddenly at the
tip, and the overstraight, shaved eyebrows&mdash;but the
whole of it had a piquant and enticing irregularity, and
it was redeemed by her large, deeply set, bluish-gray
eyes and the fine smoothness of her cream-white skin.</p>

<p>Her twenty years of life had given her a self-consciousness,
and a hasty worldly wisdom, and a slightly
complacent sexual alertness, and these three qualities
blended into the customary expressions on her face.
Yet at odd moments it showed questioning and dissatisfied
shades. She was just a little more frank and
wondering than the other girls in her environment&mdash;just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
a little distressed and seeking beneath all of the
affected wrigglings, and ignorances, and small, cruel
impulses that ruled her heart and mind. As she stood
before the bureau, the treble of a child&#8217;s voice emerged
from the babble of sounds in the surrounding apartments,
lifting the words: &#8220;Well, it ain&#8217;t gonna rain no
mo-ore, it ain&#8217;t gonna rain no mo-ore; how in the heck
can I wash my neck when it ain&#8217;t gonna rain no mo-ore.&#8221;
Blanche took up the song, half humming it as
she slipped on an old, black, sleeveless evening gown
which she still kept to wear about the apartment when
visitors were not present or expected. It had a big,
scarlet satine flower sewed at the side of the waist and
was extremely low-necked and gave her a near-courtesan
touch, increased by the over-thick rouge and
lipstick on her face. She could not dispense with cosmetics,
even before her family, because they were too
inherently a part of the shaky sexual pride within her,
which always needed to be glossed and protected because
it had been frequently hurt and discountenanced
in competitions and comparisons with the other girls
in her life.</p>

<p>She stepped down the dark hallway and entered
the living-room, where her family sat and pored over
the Sunday papers. The hour was verging on noon,
and the debris and confusion of a past breakfast stood
on the square, uncovered table in the middle of the
room. Blanche eyed it peevishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, for Gawd&#8217;s sake, what a dump,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;How&#8217;m I going to sit down with gue and coffee all
over the chairs?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;Too bad about you,&#8221; her brother, Harry, answered,
with an amiable jeer in his voice. &#8220;Too bad. We&#8217;ll
move up on the Drive an&#8217; get a lotta servunts for you,
huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, go ahead, but as long&#8217;s we&#8217;re not there yet
you c&#8217;n move your big legs and help clean off the
table,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatsamatter, you parulyzed?&#8221; he asked, still
genial as he rose and picked up some of the dishes.</p>

<p>Her sister Mabel and her oldest brother, Philip,
joined in the slangy, waggish repartee as Blanche went
to the kitchen and came back with a cup of coffee and
a fried egg. The father chortled behind the comic-section
of one of the papers, oblivious to this usual
Sunday morning &#8220;kidding-match,&#8221; and the mother
was busy in the kitchen. Harry Palmer, known to
the bantam-class of the prize-fighting ring as Battling
Murphy, was a youth of twenty-two, with a short body
whose shoulders and chest were full, hard lumps, and
whose legs were thinly crooked but steel-like. His
small, black eyes had a dully fixed, suspicious, partly
dumb and partly cunning look that never left them,
even in the midst of his greatest smiles and laughters,
and his nose was shaped like the beginning of a corkscrew,
and his thick lips just touched each other,
with the lower one slightly protruding. His moist
black hair was brushed backward; his skin was a
dark brown with a dab of red running through it.
The start of a primitive man, forced to become tricky
and indirect as it escaped from the traps and ways
of city streets, but still longing for direct blows and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
curses, showed on every inch of him. He was cruel
without wit enough to know that he was cruel, and in
his most lenient and joking moments the little imagination
and sentiment that he had grew large in its
own estimation and made him feel that he was as
decent and kind as he could be in a life where you
had to &#8220;put it over&#8221; the other fellow, or go under.</p>

<p>He prided himself especially on his generous and
affectionate attitude toward his family. They were
the only people who had any actual claims on him&mdash;his
own flesh and blood, yep&mdash;but he felt that it was
necessary to hurt them whenever they objected to his
actions, or tried to hold him down, or did anything
that they should not have done. His idea of superiority
was not to allow any one to boss him unless it
contributed to his material gain, and to order people
around whenever he could. Part of his family-pride
was a real emotion and part of it was a dogged peace-offering
to his more openly selfish and cruel words and
actions to other people. He looked upon women as
creatures made for his particular enjoyment, but they
alone were able to revive the streak of surlily shamefaced
tenderness within him, and if they were exceptionally
good-looking, and besieged by troubles, he
wanted to pet them and give them money. He intended
to avoid marriage until he met a pretty girl of his own
age, who would refuse to give herself to him, and who
could hold her own in the rough parryings of conversation,
and show a practical disposition and a sense
of the value of money.</p>

<p>He had fought in preliminary six-round bouts&mdash;with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
erratic success&mdash;since he was twenty, and he was
known to the ring as a courageous but unscientific
fighter, whose main fault was that he would not train
rigorously for his encounters. On the side he was
associated with a gang of bootleggers, in the position
of a guard who often went with them to protect their
deliveries, receiving a small share of the profits. The
Palmer family was mainly dependent on his support,
since his other brothers and sisters did little more
than pay their own expenses, and his earnings for the
past two years had really lifted them to a point where
they could have deserted their upper-proletarian life.
His parents preferred the Ninth Avenue apartment
and its surroundings, because it had been stamped
into their spirits for years, and because they liked the
boisterous freedoms, the lack of etiquette, and the
semiunderworld plainness of their environment. He
and his brothers and sisters would not have been
averse to moving to &#8220;a sweller joint,&#8221; but the desire
was not yet sufficiently deep to stir them to any action.</p>

<p>His older brother, Philip, who was twenty-five, was
looked upon as the most &#8220;high-toned&#8221; member of the
family. Philip worked in a neighboring drug store
and studied at night to become a pharmacist, and had
had two years of a high-school education. He was a
tall man of much less sturdy physique than his brother,
and he dressed in the manner of a lower dandy, with
much fussing over cravats, shirts and suits of clothes.
He had a weak face beneath his curly brown hair&mdash;the
face of a sneaking philanderer, invaded a bit by
kindly impulses which he tried to suppress but which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
often led to his undoing. His brown, bulging eyes,
soft mouth that tried to be hard, and tilting out nose
inherited from his mother&mdash;these features disputed
the sneering nonchalance with which he strove to
become one with the life around him. He was not
naturally studious, but his brain was cautious enough
to realize that he was not adapted for the more arduously
physical tasks in life, and that he would have
to learn&mdash;at any cost&mdash;some sheltering and fairly
profitable profession. For this reason he applied
himself to absorbing the details of pharmacy, with
much laboring and many secret groans.</p>

<p>His sister Mabel was the adored young coquette
of the family. They regarded Blanche as a silly, fluctuating,
and slightly queer person in comparison to
her sister, for Blanche made no serious effort &#8220;to
play&#8221; men for their money and favors, and often
went out with the poorer and more ordinary youths
of the neighborhood, and revealed, in the opinion of
her family, a spirit that was too jauntily reckless&mdash;too
&#8220;easy.&#8221; Mabel, on the other hand, was reckless
enough, with her cabaret, private club and automobile
parties, but the recklessness was more a patent exuberance
used to cover up an excellent canniness.
Her people had the feeling that she could not be taken
advantage of, and that she would play the game carefully
until she landed a wealthy man willing to marry
her. Physically, she was a girl of eighteen years,
with her body in that fetching state of transition between
budding and maturity; mentally, she was twelve
years old; and emotionally, she was a woman of fifty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Girls of her kind, whose environment has been split
between their homes in an almost slummy district and
the falsetto battle of Broadway, become sensually
wise overnight. At eighteen, Mabel was literally
stuffed with tricks, and informations, and cool wiles
picked up on streets and in cabarets, and her mind
merely functioned as an assistant in this process. At
the very bottom she was sentimental and fearful, but
only an actually dire predicament could have extracted
these qualities&mdash;an unexpected danger or calamity.
She was close to medium height, with a slenderness
made charming by an unusually full bosom, and a pale
brown skin that had a sheen upon it like that on the
surface of a pond, and black, bobbed hair that was
curled for three or four days after each visit to the
beauty parlor. Her little nose was almost straight,
with hardly a trace of the Palmer curve, and her lips
were loosely parted and petite, and her big, black eyes
assumed the most vacantly innocent of stares, unless
she was angry, when the lids half closed between
dancing sparks.</p>

<p>Her father, William Palmer, had worked as a bartender,
during the days when his country had not yet
established a new and widespread class of criminals,
and he had once owned a small saloon, afterwards
lost through his dice and poker-playing lusts. After
the advent of prohibition, he had branched out as a
bootlegger, in a very modest way, but he lacked the
vigor and acumen necessary to such an occupation&mdash;he
was now a man of fifty-five&mdash;and the arrest of
some of his cronies had frightened him into giving up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
his illegal trade. Then he became the ostensible manager
of his prize-fighting son, and now he did little
more than hang around the gymnasiums where his
son trained, dicker for a few minutes with the owners
of boxing clubs, loaf around his home, and sit in all-night
drinking and poker parties. He still had the
remains of a once powerful body, in spite of his lowered
shoulders and grayish-black hair slowly turning
to baldness, and he was one of those men who hold
out against dissipation with an inhuman tenacity,
until near seventy, when their hearts or stomachs
abruptly collapse, and they die. He was of average
height and always tried to carry himself with a great,
chipper bluff at youthful spryness. Upon his brown
face the twisted nose which he had given to his son,
Harry, stood above broad and heavy lips, and there
was a piggish fixity to his often bloodshot eyes that
were too little for the ample size of his head.</p>

<p>He was a man who lived in two worlds at the same
time&mdash;that of verbal bluffing, uttered to soothe and
shun the sore spots and cruel resolves in his nature,
and that one in which he endlessly schemed for money
and ease, and was willing to commit any legal or well-hidden
crime to procure them. He would have grown
wrathful if you had accused him of being dishonest, and
his rage would have been quite sincere. He had
practiced self-deception for such a long time that each
part of him was genuinely blind to the tactics and purposes
of the other part. His children were, to him,
the great, living boast with which he could dismiss the
world&#8217;s and his own allegations of failure. &#8220;I never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
got what I wanted but I&#8217;ll be damned if they don&#8217;t,&#8221;
he sometimes muttered to himself, and the excuse that
he gave himself was that their better advantages, and
his own guidance, would enable them to win out in the
virtues which he had transplanted within them. He
had lost his own parents at an early age and had been
raised in a public institution, and had been
forced to work hard when he was not yet fifteen, and
he doted on citing these beginnings as an explanation
for all of his material failures. He had punished and
commanded his children when they were still in knee
trousers and short skirts&mdash;often shouting at them and
beating them about the legs&mdash;and he had struggled
outragedly against their gradual assumption of authority
and independence, but his delight in remaining
their master had finally subsided to an even stronger
pleasure&mdash;that of a man who was watching the masterful
qualities which his children had derived from
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They get it honest, all right,&#8221; he had once said to
himself, after a squabble in which his son Harry, then
seventeen, had threatened to knock him out. &#8220;I never
took any sass from anybody myself, you bet I didn&#8217;t.
They&#8217;ll never learn to fight for themselves &#8217;f I take all
the spunk and pep outa them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now he clung to the gruff pose of ordering them
about, but never really cared when they disregarded
most of his words, or talked back to him, as long as
the boys kept out of arrest and the girls did not seem
to be openly or particularly unvirtuous. He suspected
that his daughters had probably &#8220;gone the limit&#8221; with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
one or two men whom they knew, but the absence of
feminine virtue to him was not a matter for agitation
unless it was persistent, complete and loudly flaunted.
He wanted his daughters to be &#8220;wise&#8221; and to end up
in decent marriages, but he was not averse to their
&#8220;cutting up&#8221; a bit, as long as they kept it well hidden.
His favorite children were Harry and Mabel and he
never overlooked any chance to flatter and serve
them in some manner.</p>

<p>His wife, Kate, was the least aggressive member of
the family, and her children, Philip and Blanche, held
in a much-qualified way many of her characteristics.
Two years younger than her husband, she was a lean
and not oversturdy woman whose head rose only an
inch above his shoulders. She had been a servant girl
just migrated from Ireland when he&mdash;a bartender in
the block in which she lived&mdash;had married her because
of his inability to seduce her in spite of her meek
worship of him, and because her turn of figure and her
tart, fresh face had appealed to him. She had toiled
most of her life, with only a short period of intermission
before the birth of her first child, and she had
frequently taken his drunken blows and his palpable
faithlessness after the first two years of their marriage,
and they had often lived in the dirtiest and
most hellish of poverties when his gambling losses
had reduced them to pennilessness, but something like
a mangled dream had never left her spirit&mdash;not plaintive,
and not precisely wistful, but more the quietness
of a peasant girl never quite living in her surroundings
and always longing for the strong peace of village and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
hill. The dream was stupid, maligned, numb&mdash;but
still it persisted. She had little courage, and yet a
stubborn flare of it often shot out when she was driven
into a corner, and her main reliances were obstinacy
and endurance. Unlike her husband, she did not share
the bragging illusions which he had concerning their
children, and she felt that her sons and daughters
were imperfect, overwild and far too selfish, and she
cared for them more because life had deprived her of
all other opportunities for compensation. She favored
Blanche most because Blanche seemed to her to be
more of a reproduction of what she, the mother, had
been in her own girlhood. It was not that she had
any keen insight into her daughter&#8217;s character and
needs&mdash;it was only the very cloudy but warm feeling
that Blanche was more honest and &#8220;fine&#8221; than the rest
of her children. Mrs. Palmer had long since ceased
to love her husband, or to respect anything about
him except his physical strength and his masculine
braveries, but she had fallen into a rut of obedience
to him, from which she lacked even the desire to
extricate herself, and she preserved an attitude of
bare affection, to impress her children and to keep
him in good humor whenever she could. She had rigid
notions concerning honesty and morality not held by
the rest of her family, and she often weakly complained
against their &#8220;looseness&#8221; and accepted it only
because she could not change it. Below her still
abundant, grayish-red hair, her face was like the
seamed and puffed and violated copy of Blanche&#8217;s
countenance, with much the same eyes, lips and nose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
but without the hopeful smiles and uncertain questions
on the other&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>As the family gathered in the living-room on this
Sunday noon, chaffing and listening to the latest fox-trot
and waltz records from the slightly nasal phonograph
that stood on a shaky table in a corner of the
room, and reading the papers with the jealous, spellbound
attention with which obscure people greet the
notorieties and &#8220;stunts&#8221; of other men and women,
the mother still worked in the kitchen, cleaning the
breakfast dishes and preparing the five o&#8217;clock Sunday
dinner. Kate Palmer usually refused to allow her
girls to help her with the housework, for more or
less selfish reasons, because of her pitiful pride in
the fact that she could manage things herself&mdash;the
elderly housewife, to whom work had become an only
distraction and importance&mdash;and because she really
dreaded the possibility of their attractive, feminine
hands becoming &#8220;chapped and ugly-like.&#8221; On Sundays
the Palmers, in varying degrees, were always in
their best mood. They had all slept later than on
other days, and the Sabbath-day was associated in
their spirits with &#8220;sorta making up for what you
pulled off during the week&#8221;&mdash;the faint, uncomprehended
return of conscience and forgotten religious
precepts&mdash;and with more peaceful forms of enjoyment.
Early every Sunday morning the mother went to a
Presbyterian church on the outskirts of their neighborhood,
and sometimes her husband or one of her
daughters would accompany her, both of them stiffly
empty and ill-at-ease. If you had asked all of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Palmers whether they believed in God and in Christianity,
they would instantly have replied in the affirmative,
after giving you a wondering, suspicious look,
and yet their belief was merely the snubbed but never-quite-relinquished
shield which their fears became
conscious of at rare and odd moments. In case you
died, you wanted to know that you were on the right
side of things and in line for some possible reward&mdash;this
was the only shape that religion had to them.
Its exhortations and restrictions were jokes that could
not possibly survive in the sordidness, and strain,
and sensual longing of your life&mdash;you knew that at
the bottom but you never admitted it to yourself on
the top. Again, there was a consolation, dim and yet
imperative, in feeling that a vast, hazy, grand Father
was controlling their days, and in moments of sore
need, or danger, or pain, they would have instinctively
and even beseechingly called out His name.</p>

<p>When the papers were exhausted, the conversation
of the Palmers became more steady and personal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re goin&#8217; out to-night with that Jew-kike
uh yours,&#8221; said Harry, trying to get a rise out of
Blanche. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you pick out somethin&#8217; better than
a Christ-killer, huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it to you?&#8221; she asked, coolly. &#8220;Show you
a good-looking Jewish girl and you&#8217;ll fall all over
yourself trying to date her up. I know you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, but I&#8217;d just play her for what I could get,&#8221;
answered Harry. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a notion you&#8217;re kinda
sweet on that Loo-ee Rosenberg, &#8217;r whatever his name
is.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;d better not be,&#8221; said the father, with
a scowl. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind when some kike takes her out
for a good time&mdash;their jack&#8217;s as good as any other
guy&#8217;s&mdash;but I&#8217;m not lettin&#8217; any Jews get into this
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blanche gave them a scornful smile. She was far
from being in love with Rosenberg, and the matter
was neither pressing nor irritating, but she felt a
general defiance against their masculine habit of laying
down the law to women.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m old enough to tend my own business,
pa,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are, huh,&#8221; answered her father. &#8220;Well,
maybe we&#8217;ll see about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, I know what&#8217;s eating both of you,&#8221; said
Mabel, in her expressionless, thinly liquid voice.
&#8220;You&#8217;re sore &#8217;cause Harry lost to a Jew in that fight
he had up in Harlem. Kid Goldman, that&#8217;s the one.
When you going to beat him up, Harry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get him, I&#8217;ll get him, don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; her brother
answered, frowning as he remembered the affront to
his vanity. &#8220;I was outa condition that night, and my
left wasn&#8217;t workin&#8217; good, that&#8217;s all. Wait&#8217;ll I get him
in the ring again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I&#8217;ve always told you&mdash;you got
the makin&#8217;s of a champion &#8217;f you&#8217;ll only get down to
business,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;You&#8217;re trailin&#8217; around too
much with that bootleggin&#8217; gang uh yours. No fighter
ever got to the top with a bottle in his hand, I&#8217;m
tellin&#8217; you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan, you know damn well I&#8217;m down to the gym<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
five days a week,&#8221; answered Harry, who realized the
truth of his father&#8217;s words, but wanted to minimize it
with his own reply. &#8220;An&#8217; what&#8217;s more, I don&#8217;t see any
of you turnin&#8217; down that fifty they slip me ev&#8217;ry Monday.
Money don&#8217;t lay around on the street&mdash;you got
to get it any place you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I ain&#8217;t any too anxious &#8217;bout hearin&#8217; the cops
knockin&#8217; on this door some day,&#8221; his father responded,
peevishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead, drink your fool self to death&mdash;who
cares,&#8221; said Mabel, who had become petulant at the
thought of the grand style in which they could all
live if her brother would only rise to the head of his
class. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got plenty of muscle but no sense,
that&#8217;s the trouble with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, how many times &#8217;ve you seen me drunk, how
many?&#8221; Harry asked, beginning to be angry at this
exposure of his weakest trait. &#8220;Ev&#8217;ry one in this
joint&#8217;s always lappin&#8217; up all I bring home, an&#8217; I never
touch it myself. &#8217;F I do go on a jag once&#8217;n a while
it&#8217;s my business. You can&#8217;t get up in the fight game
unless you&#8217;re on the inside&mdash;there&#8217;s too many big
crooks higher up fixin&#8217; things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it&mdash;you&#8217;re just looking for a way
out,&#8221; said Blanche, to whom Harry was a generous
but conceited brother&mdash;a strong, vicious baby who
imagined himself to be a model of shrewdness. At
the bottom she disliked his bulldozing, prying ways,
but her dislike was not yet strong enough to overcome
the more enforced feelings of gratitude and
blood-ties within her heart. Harry always suspected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
that Blanche was the one member of his family not
impressed by his prowess and his knowledge of the
world, and he never gave up his efforts to increase her
respect, with all the argument and repartee at his
command.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, huh,&#8221; he said, answering her last remark.
&#8220;What do you know about it? I suppose you get all
that info&#8217; uh yours punchin&#8217; the cash register down
at the cafeteria. The only way you&#8217;re wise is with
your mouth. That middle-weight champ fight down
at the Terrace was fixed up a week ago and I&#8217;ve got
it straight. Just watch the papers tuhmorrow night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, I&#8217;ve heard a lotta roomors goin&#8217; around, but
that&#8217;s hot air,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;Garvey&#8217;d be a damn
fool to sell his title for any amount&mdash;I don&#8217;t care
&#8217;fit&#8217;s one hundred thousan&#8217;. He ain&#8217;t had it a year yet,
an&#8217; there&#8217;s plenty uh holes left in the meal-ticket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to somethin&#8217;, will yuh,&#8221; answered Harry,
who really knew what he was talking about in this
matter. &#8220;Garvey&#8217;s gonna give up the title now and
then win it back in a return bout. Lose it on a foul
an&#8217; raise a big holler&mdash;that&#8217;s the scheme. Young
Anderson&#8217;ll keep it f&#8217;r a year &#8217;r so, an&#8217; make a pile
of dough cleanin&#8217; up all the suckers in the sticks.
With the movie stuff an&#8217; the easy pickin&#8217;s he&#8217;ll rake in
three times &#8217;s much as his manager give Garvey&#8217;s tuh
fix it all up. I got it from a guy who was there when
they all talked it over, only I can&#8217;t say his name &#8217;cause
I&#8217;d get my bean drilled through &#8217;f they ever found out
I told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you kiddin&#8217; me?&#8221; demanded his father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;I hope to croak if I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, boy, watch me put thirty dollars on that fight,&#8221;
cried Philip, who had been sitting beside his father and
listening avidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go slow, go slow,&#8221; advised his father. &#8220;I
know Harry wouldn&#8217;t give us a bum stir, but them
agreements &#8217;r&#8217; often bungled up &#8217;r double-crossed at
the last minnit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men began a discussion of prize-fighting conditions
in general, with much vehemence and a comical
contrast of naive and foxy opinions, and the two
girls brought out manicure-sets of flashy celluloid, and
fiddled with their nails. Something that was not depression
but unobtrusively akin to it, stirred inside of
Blanche. She had felt it at times before and had
never been able to fathom it beyond her sense that
life was too underhanded, and that she didn&#8217;t like
this aspect of it. As she listened to the men, with
their endless recitals of frauds and machinations, the
little weight moved within her breast. Fake, fake,
fake&mdash;that was all you ever heard. Wasn&#8217;t there anything
honest and good in the world? It sure didn&#8217;t
look like there was, most of the time. Oh, well, why
bother so much about it? You could never get along
in this world unless you &#8220;belonged&#8221;&mdash;unless you were
like the things around you.</p>

<p>She started to think of Louis Rosenberg, the man
with whom she had an engagement for the coming
night. She didn&#8217;t love him, sure not, but he wasn&#8217;t a
bad fellow at that. He seemed to be an honest boy,
and sometimes he talked about big, fancy things, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
why people hated each other so much, and why the
world wasn&#8217;t better than it was, and he used a word
now and then that he called art&mdash;something that
made people write books and do paintings and statuary,
and get wild over nothing that any one else could
see. He certainly was different from most men all
right. He kissed her sometimes, but he never tried
to &#8220;get fresh&#8221; (getting fresh, to Blanche, was the
placing of a man&#8217;s hands upon any covered part of
her body except the arms). Maybe that was why she
didn&#8217;t love him. He was too darn good, and a girl
wanted a fellow to &#8220;try something&#8221; now and then,
if he was slow about it and didn&#8217;t act as though he
expected her to fall for him (respond to him) immediately.
Then, when he did try it, she could tell just
how much she cared for him, and she repulsed him,
or accepted him to some extent, according to how
nervous and glad he made her feel. Well, anyway,
there were always enough men who tried to make
advances to her, and Rosenberg was something of a
relief.</p>

<p>She met him that night on the corner of Broadway
and Forty-second Street, where the theater lights
clustered like bits of a soul burning in oil, and an
endless, crawling stream of automobiles and taxicabs
hid the pavement, and where the tall, rectangular
buildings and the suavely gaudy shops seemed to be
the only unexcited and unsensual objects of the scene.
Rosenberg scarcely ever called for her at the apartment,
and when he did he waited outside on the stoop,
because Blanche felt that she would be &#8220;mortified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
to death&#8221; if her father and her brothers should choose
to act unfriendly toward him, and she didn&#8217;t want to
run the risk of such an occurrence. She was wearing
a very thin, short-sleeved, georgette dress that extended
only two inches below her knees and was of
dull white with a dark red flower-pattern, and semi-transparent,
flesh-colored stockings, and brown shoes
with high heels, and a black felt hat shaped like an
upside-down cup, with a red bow at the side. Like
many girls in her environment, she dressed with a
combination of unconscious artistry and cheap, over-flashy
display.</p>

<p>Rosenberg was a youth of twenty-three, who worked
at the receiving desk in one of the Public Library
branches, and was beginning to think a bit too much
for his happiness, prodded by the &#8220;higher literature&#8221;
that he was reading for the first time. Previous to
his Library job he had worked as a shoe salesman
and had given it up because he had failed to see that
he was &#8220;getting anywhere&#8221; and because he wanted to
do something out of the ordinary but didn&#8217;t know
quite what it should be. He lived with a family of
brothers and sisters, and they, together with his parents,
regarded him as a pleasant &#8220;schlemiel,&#8221; who was
always talking about things but never accomplishing
anything, though they were willing to let him alone
as long as he worked and supported himself. He had
met Blanche at the cafeteria where she worked as a
cashier on weekdays, through the expedient of opening
a gradual conversation with her as he paid his
check each noon. Finally he had grown bold enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
to ask if he could &#8220;take her out&#8221; and she had assented
because she had liked the diffident style in which his
request was worded.</p>

<p>He was tall and narrow-shouldered, but he was
wiry and his arms were not unmuscular. His light
brown face, with its hooked nose, dark, large-lidded
eyes, and thin mouth, often had the look of a puzzled
dreamer, bowing to practical barriers but still trying,
half-heartedly, to peer beyond them. In his attire
he wavered between negligence and neatness, his tastes
running to dark suits and loose collars and brightly
striped shirts, and his leading vanity was his wavy
black hair, which he often combed for ten minutes at
a stretch.</p>

<p>Since the hour was only eight o&#8217;clock&mdash;still too
early for them to visit the lower Broadway dance-hall
which they frequented&mdash;Blanche and Rosenberg
walked over to Bryant Park and sat on one of the
wooden-iron benches along the cement walk and looking
out on the orderly, clipped levels of grass. The
late spring night, with its warm air that had the barest
threat of coolness in it, and its cloudless sky dotted
with stars and a moon at which you could glance now
and then with the feeling that they were pretty and
a bit mystifying, and the more immediate lights
around you, with their warm, come-on-and-see-what&#8217;s-under-me
winks, and all the sounds of pleasure-seeking
traffic&mdash;these things brought Blanche a light-hearted,
knowing mood. She was a girl, young and
rather handsome, and there was nothing that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
couldn&#8217;t make men do if she had only cared enough
about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you what we&#8217;ll do, Lou, we&#8217;ll take that ferry
ride over to Staten Island,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I love to get
out on the water when it&#8217;s night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not and say we did,&#8221; he answered, moodily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, I never saw a fellow like you,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;Dance, dance, that&#8217;s all you care about. Here I
know you&#8217;re short on money, and here I&#8217;m giving you
a chance to get away with forty cents for the night&mdash;four
thin dimes&mdash;and you turn it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t always rub in how poor I am,&#8221; he said,
nettled. &#8220;&#8217;F I was so darn crazy about money, like
other guys are, I&#8217;d get it all right. There&#8217;s other things
I&#8217;m interested in&mdash;books, and good plays, and watching
what other people do. They all call me lazy at
home, but it don&#8217;t bother me any. I don&#8217;t see that
they get so much out of life by working their heads
off all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blanche felt a little scornful and a little inquiring
as she listened to him. Who ever heard of saying that
people shouldn&#8217;t work&mdash;what would become of them
if they didn&#8217;t? Besides, what did he get out of all
his reading and this &#8220;think-ing&#8221; of his? He was a
boob in many respects, and in a way she was wasting
her time with him. She could have been in the company
of men who could show her an actual good time&mdash;high-class
cabarets and automobile parties, and the
best theaters and restaurants. Yet, after she went out
with these men for a while she always grew tired of
them. They all got down to what they wanted from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
her, and it became a bald question of taking or rejecting
them&mdash;you couldn&#8217;t &#8220;string them along&#8221; forever&mdash;and
they all lacked something that she was
unable to put her finger on&mdash;something &#8220;classy&#8221; and
aboveboard and decent without being goody-goodish.
When she &#8220;let them go too far,&#8221; under the hilarious
urge of liquor, she never felt quite right about it
afterwards. She could never rid herself of the feeling
that the man had not deserved what he had received
and that she had been just another girl on his list.
Rosenberg was the one man who came nearest to fulfilling
this mysterious lack, but he was deficient in all
of the other requisites, and his physical appeal was
weak to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t read a book when you dance, do
you?&#8221; she asked at last, desiring to take a mild jab
at him. &#8220;Gee, but you&#8217;re the cat&#8217;s something. I wish
you had more get-up about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, it&#8217;s too bad I haven&#8217;t got a roll,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;Sometimes I b&#8217;lieve that&#8217;s all you girls think about.&#8221;</p>

<p>An anger mounted within her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, &#8217;f I did, why&#8217;d I have to pick you out?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;You make me sick and tired!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, don&#8217;t get so sore,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m touchy
in one spot, that&#8217;s all. Let&#8217;s talk about something
else. I was reading a book called First Street the
other day&mdash;it&#8217;s highbrow, you know, but it&#8217;s darn
popular, too. I hear they&#8217;ve sold a hundred thousand.
It tells all about how gossipy-like and narrow-minded
and, oh, just small, people are&mdash;the people that live in
those little burgs.... Say, the more I find out about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
this world of ours the less I like it. Why the devil
can&#8217;t people leave each other alone, and do what they
want, long&#8217;s they&#8217;re not hurting anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>His last words made Blanche sympathize with him,
in spite of the fact that, to her, there was an unmanly
element in what he said. Real men, now, went out
and fought with each other, and &#8220;stood the gaff&#8221; and
&#8220;got what was coming to them&#8221; and made people obey
them. Still there was too darn much bossing in the
world, with ev&#8217;rybody sticking his finger in the other
person&#8217;s pie. Her family was always nagging at her,
and the owner of the cafeteria was always telling her
what to do&mdash;thought he owned her for his measly
twenty-two a week&mdash;and the cop on the corner gave
you a rotten look if he saw you walking alone late at
night ... yes, too darn much bossing to suit her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that there word, narruh-mindud, &#8217;r something
like that&mdash;what&#8217;s it mean?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means when you don&#8217;t see nothing except what&#8217;s
right in front of your eyes,&#8221; he answered, delighted
at the chance to show his wisdom. &#8220;That&#8217;s what ails
most of us, all right. When you&#8217;re narrow-minded,
you see, you want everybody to be like you are and
you go right up in the air when people don&#8217;t act the
way you do. That&#8217;s what it means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve got to be like other people &#8217;r else
you&#8217;ll never get anywheres,&#8221; she said, uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, in lots of things,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but
just the same you can&#8217;t be arrested for what&#8217;s going
on in your head. You c&#8217;n have all the ideas you want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
to, &#8217;s long as you don&#8217;t pull off any crime, &#8217;r bother
anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>She liked the queerness of his words, for no discernible
reason other than that he seemed to be in
favor of &#8220;standing up for yourself,&#8221; and not always
believing what people told you. Not so bad at that,
only&mdash;try&mdash;and&mdash;do&mdash;it! Oh, well, what did all this
have to do with the night ahead of them? This funny
boy was her escort for the night, and she was a desirable
woman, and she wished that he would &#8220;cut
out&#8221; all of the heavy stuff and make love to her, or
pay her some compliments, or do something that men
did when they were &#8220;gone&#8221; on a girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you never kill yourself paying any attention
to <i>me</i>,&#8221; she said, after a pause. &#8220;It&#8217;s always them
i-i-deeuhs uh yours. Why, I know piles uh men that
would jump all over themselves just for the chance to
sit &#8217;longside uh me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been looking away from her, and now he
turned his head, stung, and sorrowfully hungry, and
much more upset than he dared to confess to himself,
as he took in the appetizing, fresh sauciness of her
face, and the suggestive witchcraft of her pent-up
breast. There was a come-and-get-me-if-you&#8217;re-able,
and an almost smiling expression on her face. Without
realizing it, he always made an additional effort to
talk about &#8220;deep things&#8221; when he was with her, to
escape from the unsteadying influence which she had
upon his emotions. The other girls whom he occasionally
took to moving-picture theaters and dances,
were more or less inviting to him according to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
shape of their faces&mdash;he was fond of very plump
cheeks and lips with a large fullness to them&mdash;and
whether they had ample but not too corpulent forms&mdash;but
otherwise he did not differentiate them, except
in the light of whether they were &#8220;good kidders&#8221;
(brightly loquacious about nothing in particular) or
unduly silent and tiresome. Blanche, however, incited
within him a quick-rhythmed trouble and respect
which he could not explain, outside of his desire to
embrace her. She never seemed to have much
&#8220;brains,&#8221; but still he felt that there was something
to her that life hadn&#8217;t given her a chance to develop&mdash;something
honest and undismayed.</p>

<p>He had no actual ability at clear thinking, in spite
of all of his poor little defiances and boldnesses abstracted
from this book and that, but he did have a
questioning, dissatisfied spirit&mdash;a spirit prone to quick
melancholies and even quicker hopes, and always trying
to &#8220;find out what it all meant.&#8221; He had the desire
to make Blanche worthy of him, and to give her the
knowledges and bystandish rebukes toward life on
which he prided himself. He told himself that he was
an idealist in sexual matters and that he was waiting
for a girl who could show him a clean, aspiring, beautiful
love, free from all coquetries and hagglings, and
he used the impressive adjectives to serenade his sense
of sexual frustration. In reality, he was oversexed,
and not bold enough to capture the girls whom he
secretly desired, but that was not the whole of it&mdash;far
beneath him he really did long for a physical outlet
that would be much less sordid and common than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the ones within his reach. At rare intervals he would
visit some professional woman, whose card had been
given to him by one of his more rakish friends, and
go away from her with a relieved but downcast mood.</p>

<p>While he felt that he was in love with Blanche, he
didn&#8217;t want to be too quick about telling her&mdash;you
had to wait and be sure that some other girl, even
more alluring, wouldn&#8217;t come along&mdash;and since she
didn&#8217;t seem to be in love with him, his pride made
him silent at the thought of a probable rejection.
Often, when he kissed her good-night, his longing to
&#8220;go farther&#8221; would be close to overpowering him, but
at this moment she always slipped efficiently out of his
arms and said her last farewell. To Blanche, kisses
of any length were equivalents to saying &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Rosenberg sat beside Blanche now, after her
girlishly taunting words, he lost control of himself for
the first time, and his hand dropped tightly on one
of her knees, but she rose instantly from the bench.
She wasn&#8217;t angry at his having become &#8220;fresh&#8221; because
she blamed herself for it, but at the same time
she didn&#8217;t want to encourage him. He was a nice
enough kid, but somehow when he touched her she
didn&#8217;t get any &#8220;kick&#8221; out of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not here, Lou&mdash;c&#8217;mon, let&#8217;s go,&#8221; she said, trying
to put a look of cajoling promise on her face.</p>

<p>They walked over to &#8220;Dreamland,&#8221; the place where
they usually danced. It was a moderately large hall,
where the admission price was only two dollars for
couples, and it catered to a nondescript array of patrons.
Those who attended it regularly were in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
main young blades with small salaries and gay ambitions,
and working-girls who desired to &#8220;step out&#8221;
at night, but you could spy a variety of other people
who dropped in occasionally. The place hired twelve
professional girl dancers, who sat on a row of green
wicker chairs and waited for customers, and there
was a booth wherein a lady, who looked like a middle-aged,
superannuated burlesque actress, dispensed
tickets, each of which entitled the bearer to a dance
with one of the hired girls. Three or four professional
male dancers in tuxedoes lolled opposite the girls and
waited for feminine patrons. They were mostly in
demand for the tango and the Charleston&mdash;more intricate
dances which most of the other men present
had not mastered. Prosperous, middle-aged business
men frequently dropped in to dance with the girl
&#8220;hostesses&#8221; and a buxom, overripe, overdressed,
smirking woman&mdash;who supervised this part of the
hall&#8217;s activities&mdash;went through the respectable farce
of inquiring each gentleman&#8217;s name and introducing
him to his &#8220;hostess&#8221; partner. Many youths, &#8220;hard up&#8221;
for the evening and desiring an excellent and &#8220;swell-looking&#8221;
dancer, and many out-of-town visitors, pining
for deviltry during the vacation from their families,
were also frequent patrons. In addition, a large
number of unattached men drifted about the hall and
solicited dances from single girls, who accepted or
rejected them according to whether they were well-dressed
and talked with the proper confident, wise-cracking
inflections. The dance floor covered almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
one-half of the hall&#8217;s space and was separated by a
wooden railing from the remainder of the place.</p>

<p>With its bright green wicker armchairs, and floor of
dark red plush, and varicolored electric lights hanging
in bunches from the ceiling, and badly done paintings
of women and cherubs and flowers on the surface
of the walls, and canopied, bedecked platform at one
side of the dance floor, where eight jazz players performed,
the hall gave you the general effect of spurious
romance putting on its best front to hide the decay
of its heart. The aura of respectability that hung
over the place was an amusing and desperate deception.
Two guards stood on the dance floor and reprimanded
couples when they shimmied, or moved with
a too undulating slowness, and other attendants
watched the rows of wicker chairs and censored any
open &#8220;spooning&#8221; among the patrons, and yet the hall
was quite patently an inception-ground for rendezvous,
and assignations, and flirtations, and covert
flesh-pressures. The &#8220;hostesses&#8221; took soft drinks with
their steadiest partners, at one end of the hall, with
much touching of knees and flitting of hands under
the tables, to induce the men to spend more freely&mdash;overrouged
and lip-sticked girls, with bobbed hair
and plump faces where sex had become the most automatic
and shallow of signals. They wore short evening
gowns, sleeveless and with low necks, and they &#8220;innocently&#8221;
crossed their legs to show an inch or two of
bare flesh above their rolled-up, thinnest stockings,
and then uncrossed them again when they perceived
that some man was staring at the exposure, keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
up these back-and-forth movements as though an innuendo
with springs and wheels had replaced all of
the sexual spontaneity within them.</p>

<p>Blanche and Rosenberg danced again and again to
the jerky, moaning, truculently snickering ache and
dementia of the music. To Blanche, dancing was the
approved, indirect way in which you could relieve
your sex without compromising it, and as she was
hugged tightly against Rosenberg, he became desirable
to her because the music and steps transformed him
and cast a rhythmical glamor upon his body. She had
the same feeling with any man with whom she danced,
unless he was old or inept, and when she danced with
a man who was physically attractive off the dance
floor as well, the sensation rose to an all-conquering
and haughty semiecstasy. Then she held her head
high, and closed her eyes occasionally, and wished
that darkness would suddenly descend on the floor.</p>

<p>After their first few dances, Blanche and Rosenberg
sat down, breathless, and without a thought in their
heads. To Rosenberg, dances were opportunities to
embrace a girl without interference or remonstrance,
but beyond that the music made him feel that he was
capering on the divine top of the world, where such
dull and mournful things as jobs, and money worries,
and alarm clocks, and family quarrels had been deliciously
left behind.</p>

<p>In front of Blanche, a bulky, short man, in a dark
suit with the latest wide-bottomed trousers, was trying
&#8220;to make&#8221; a dark, barely smiling girl, slender and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
dressed in a clinging gray gown, who refused to answer
his remarks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, I&#8217;m as popular around here as the German
measles,&#8221; he said loudly.</p>

<p>The girl smiled more apparently but failed to
answer him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, just try me once,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;Just one
dance. I&#8217;ll pay the doctor bills if I make you sick.
I&#8217;m a good sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl smiled more widely but still remained
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will somebody tell me why I&#8217;m living?&#8221; he queried
to the air above her head. &#8220;Boy, but it&#8217;s cold to-night!
I left the old automatic at home so I can&#8217;t die
just yet, girlie. Come on, just one dance, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the girl was fully convinced of his
glib-tongued, regular-guy status, and felt that he had
implored enough to serve as a sufficient payment for
his dance. She rose, without a word, and accompanied
him to the floor. Similar episodes were being enacted
around Blanche and Rosenberg, and he said, with a
grin: &#8220;It sure gets me when I listen to what you girls
fall for. That&#8217;s why I lose out&mdash;I hate to talk that
kind of line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go on, you&#8217;d do it if you could,&#8221; answered
Blanche. &#8220;A girl always likes a fellow &#8217;f he knows
how to be funny and don&#8217;t carry it too far. You know
what I mean. I never was so crazy &#8217;bout this kidding
stuff myself, but then maybe that&#8217;s why you like me,
isn&#8217;t it, Lou?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got something in you, all right,&#8221; he replied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
&#8220;You don&#8217;t know so much more&#8217;n other girls, but you
make me feel that you&#8217;re diff&#8217;rent, anyway. I guess
it&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t put up so much bluffing and
leading a fellow on, like other girls do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed to hide her pleasure at the compliment,
and because another part of her said inaudibly: &#8220;Oh,
I don&#8217;t, eh? Well, I&#8217;ll show you, before I&#8217;m through!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a funny fellow, but I&#8217;ve met them worse
than you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>They danced until 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, after which he escorted
her to the apartment. As they stood in the musty,
narrow, dimly lit hallway, an emotion like a Roman-candle
spun around in his breast, and for the first
time he grasped her with rough, active hands, and
breathed hard as he whispered short, incoherent
pleadings. She pushed him back with an undeniable
anger and force which made him grow still and dismayed,
and they stood for a moment, looking at each
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you&#8217;re like all the rest of &#8217;em,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;What do you think I am? You&#8217;ve got your nerve,
you have. You can&#8217;t put your hands on me that way,
and don&#8217;t forget it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he answered, downcast. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
mean to act like that, but something got the better
of me. I couldn&#8217;t think of anything except I wanted
you. I&#8217;m in love with you, Blanche, and I guess I
didn&#8217;t know it till just now. I&#8217;d ask you to marry me
to-morrow &#8217;f I had money enough to keep us going.&#8221;</p>

<p>She softened at this switch to a &#8220;decent&#8221; proposal,
and she reproached herself for having flirted too much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
with him without loving him or caring a great deal
for his embraces. She liked to hear him talk, but
when he touched her he was awkward and hasty, and
without that winning blend of confidence and gradual
boldness which she liked in a man&#8217;s approaches.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s my fault, too,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
love you, Lou, but I do like you lots. Maybe I will
some time. How c&#8217;n any girl be sure about that? I
don&#8217; want to stop going with you &#8217;f you&#8217;ll just try to
be friends with me, Lou.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood for a moment without answering&mdash;discouraged
and resentful. Somehow he never seemed to
get anything that he really wanted&mdash;what was the use
of it all. She li-iked the way he talked, oh, yes, but
she preferred to save herself for some empty-pated
cake-eater, some know-it-all fellow with a straight
nose and a bunch of bum jokes and a string of promises
about what he was going to do for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t see why
you don&#8217;t care for me. I&#8217;ve got just as good a head
as any one else you know, and I&#8217;m not so terrible
looking, and I know you wouldn&#8217;t turn me down just
&#8217;cause I&#8217;m poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cert&#8217;nly wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you
why I don&#8217;t love you&mdash;it&#8217;s just not there, that&#8217;s all.
I think you&#8217;re a nice boy, really I do, and I want to
keep seeing you, but what&#8217;s the use of letting you do
things to me when it don&#8217;t mean nothing?... I&#8217;ve
got to go upstairs now&mdash;I feel like I could sleep ten
hours. We sure did dance a lot to-night. Listen, call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
me up next Thursday noon, at the caf&#8217;, and we&#8217;ll go
some place Thursday night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll give you a ring,&#8221; he answered, dully.
&#8220;I guess you can&#8217;t help how you feel, Blanche.&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her good-night, and she let his lips stay
for a while, out of pity, and then broke away from
him. As she went to bed, she had a muddled, wondering
feeling&mdash;why did she always turn down boys that
were &#8220;good&#8221; and willing to marry her, and why didn&#8217;t
she object to the embraces of &#8220;bad&#8221; men, who were
just looking for an easy prospect? Maybe she was a
little &#8220;bad&#8221; herself&mdash;a little like May Harrigan, whose
name was the jest of the neighborhood, and who
grabbed any young fellow that came along.... Her
perturbations faded out into sleep.</p>

<p>On the next morning she was still a bit glum at the
cafeteria, but it was no more than the least of shadows
as she exchanged glances and repartee with various
customers who paid their checks. When she sat before
the cash register, her business-like tension extended
even to the sexual side of her, and she uttered her
set phrases merely to dispose of the men who talked
to her, and with little interest in their faces and words.
During the lull-hours, however, between two and four
in the afternoon, she relaxed, and the appraising tingles
of her sex came back, and she entered into badinage
with the proprietor and the counter-men and
stray customers whom she knew. Her confined perch
on the cashier&#8217;s stool had to be forgotten in some
way.</p>

<p>The cafeteria had rows of brightly varnished chairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
with broad arms, and tables with white, enameled
tops, and a sprinkle of sawdust on the tiled floor.
Pyramids of oranges and grapefruit stood in the windows,
and the glass-walled food counters were heaped
with pastry, cold meats and trays of salads and puddings.
The smell of soggy, overspiced food and body-odors
possessed the air, and a spirit of dreamless,
hasty, semidirty devouring hung over the place. On
this afternoon, Blanche was chatting with the proprietor,
a tall Jew of forty years, with a jowled, bloodless
face, killed black eyes that were always shifting
about in the fear that they might be missing something,
and the thickest of lips. His coat was off and
he wore an expensive, monogramed silk shirt of green
and white stripes, and had a cigar forever in his
mouth or hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Check up yet on the accounts?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep, ev&#8217;rything&#8217;s straight,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I bought a beauty of uh coat f&#8217;r my wiff
yesterday,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She can&#8217;t say I ever hold out
on <i>her</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, isn&#8217;t that nice&mdash;she must be tickled to
death,&#8221; said Blanche, giving him the flattering words
that he wanted to hear. &#8220;Nobody ever slips me any
swell coats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if they don&#8217;t it&#8217;s your fault,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;You could work a fellow f&#8217;r anything you wanted&mdash;you&#8217;ve
got the goods, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, quit your kidding,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
take no prizes in a beauty show.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>&#8220;You would if I was one uh the judges,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>He poked her in the side, playfully, and she smiled
carefully. You had to take such things from your
boss&mdash;it was all in the game&mdash;but you wished that
he would keep his hands to himself&mdash;the fat old
lobster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any time you wanna take a little ride in my machine,
it&#8217;s there,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, I&#8217;d be afraid of you,&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;I think
you&#8217;re <i>some</i> devil, you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>He chuckled at the praise of his masculine gifts,
and walked back to the kitchen in response to a call.
The cafeteria was located in a manufacturing and
wholesale district where practically all of the trade
occurred around the noon hour, and it closed its doors
at 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> When Blanche returned to the apartment,
Harry, Philip and Mabel were sitting at the supper-table
(the father happened to be visiting one of his
cronies uptown).</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I met a guy to-day said he saw you at Dreamland
las&#8217; night,&#8221; said Philip, when Blanche came to
the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh-huh, I was there,&#8221; said Blanche.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t be seen in a bum joint like that,&#8221;
Mabel commented. &#8220;You certainly have a gift f&#8217;r
pickin&#8217; out the penny-squeezers, Blanie. Me f&#8217;r the
Club Breauville, &#8217;r places like that. They put on the
best show you ever saw&mdash;Hawkins &#8217;n Dale, straight
from the Palace Theater, and a big, A-number-one
chorus.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;Aw, rats, you&#8217;re always worrying what a fella&#8217;s
going to spend on you,&#8221; said Blanche. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got
a peach of a jazz-band at Dreamland, and a dandy
floor&mdash;that&#8217;s all I care about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your tastes &#8217;r sim-ply aw-ful,&#8221; Mabel answered,
&#8220;and what&#8217;s more, why shouldn&#8217;t a girl go with high-class
fellas and have &#8217;em spend piles on her? That&#8217;s
what they&#8217;re made for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t blame you none,&#8221; said Philip, &#8220;but
believe me, I&#8217;d never pick out a wife like you. You
sure would keep a fella on the go digging it up for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mabel don&#8217;t mean anything by it,&#8221; said his mother,
who had come in from the kitchen, &#8220;but I wish she
wouldn&#8217;t stay out so late. I get to worryin&#8217; when she
comes home three an&#8217; four an&#8217; five in the mornin&#8217;. You
never can tell what&#8217;ll happen to a girl in this city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, ma, don&#8217;t fret, I can take care of myself,&#8221;
Mabel said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what they all say,&#8221; Harry broke in. &#8220;I was
talkin&#8217; to a fella to-day, said his kid sister got into a
scrape out in Jersey. Two guys started scrappin&#8217; over
her in a machine, and one of &#8217;em&#8217;s dyin&#8217; in the hospital,
and the bulls &#8217;r after her. It was in the papers yesterday.
You better watch y&#8217;r step, Mabe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, no girl &#8217;cept a fool would go out in a machine
with two guys,&#8221; answered Mabel. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take &#8217;em one at
a time, believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do think you&#8217;re too free with the men, an&#8217;
you only eighteen,&#8221; her mother said, looking at Mabel
in a ruefully helpless way. &#8220;It&#8217;s I that can&#8217;t hold you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
down, and it&#8217;s I that never could, but I&#8217;m wishin&#8217; you&#8217;d
stay home once&#8217;n a while. How&#8217;ll you ever get a decint
man to make a decint proposal to you, how&#8217;ll you ever,
runnin&#8217; round with that fast crowd uh yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan, she&#8217;ll land a big one yet, &#8217;fore she&#8217;s
through,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Mabe&#8217;s a wise girlie, and I&#8217;m
with her all the time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; Mabel answered affectionately, as she
pulled her brother&#8217;s hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose I&#8217;m the boob uh this fam&#8217;ly,&#8221; said Blanche,
&#8220;but I won&#8217;t lose no sleep over it. &#8217;F I like the way a
man talks, &#8217;n how he looks, I don&#8217;t care what&#8217;s the size
of his roll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You got it from me, you did,&#8221; her mother said, with
a dully soft look. &#8220;It&#8217;s I that married your father when
he hadn&#8217;t a cent to his name. &#8217;Twas the way he could
blarney, &#8217;twas that, and &#8217;twas the face of him that made
me take him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, pa&#8217;s all right, but he&#8217;s shy on brains,&#8221; Mabel
said. &#8220;&#8217;F I ever get hooked up with any man he&#8217;s got
to have plenty uh money, and then some. I&#8217;m worth
all the dough in the world &#8217;cordin&#8217; to my way uh thinkin&#8217;,
and I&#8217;m not scrubbin&#8217; floors for no fella this year
&#8217;r next. This lovin&#8217;-up stuff don&#8217;t get you much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, Blanche is a mut with alla her Rosinburgs,
&#8217;n Kellies, &#8217;n all the rest uh them tin-horn pikers,&#8221; said
Harry. &#8220;I know how she&#8217;ll wind up, all right. Some
guy&#8217;ll have her washin&#8217; his clothes an makin&#8217; her like
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;s been washing yours and pa&#8217;s for years, but
you&#8217;re not kicking about that,&#8221; answered Blanche.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
&#8220;Anyway it won&#8217;t be some one like you. You think
that row-mance is something people clean their shoes
with, you do. You&#8217;ve got a heart like a oyster, I&#8217;ll
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Row-ma-ance, that&#8217;s good,&#8221; answered Harry, derisively.
&#8220;Try an&#8217; cash in on it at the butcher shop an&#8217;
see what you get.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m on Blanie&#8217;s side,&#8221; said Philip, who liked
his older sister because she was &#8220;softer&#8221; than the other
members of the family. &#8220;When I marry a girl she&#8217;s
got to love me, first, last, &#8217;n&#8217; all the time. I&#8217;m strong
for the jack, sure, but there&#8217;s other things hanging
around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, isn&#8217;t Joe Campbell comin&#8217; up to-night?&#8221; asked
Mabel, turning to Blanche.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, I&#8217;ve got a date with him f&#8217;r eight-thirty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now there&#8217;s a guy you oughta play up to,&#8221; said
Harry. &#8220;He takes down a good three hundred a week
f&#8217;r that turn he does up at The Golden Mill. Joe&#8217;s as
wise as they make &#8217;em&mdash;a wise-crackin&#8217; baby. I&#8217;m
gonna stick around when he comes up here to-night.
He c&#8217;n get a laugh outa me any day in the year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe&#8217;s there, all right,&#8221; Mabel said. &#8220;I wish he
wasn&#8217;t so sweet on Blanche.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go after him, dearie, if that&#8217;s how you feel,&#8221;
Blanche answered. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be breaking my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she dressed herself for the coming engagement,
Blanche had an uneven, up-in-the-air song in her blood.
Another man would soon be courting her, and casting
&#8220;I&#8217;d-like-to-get-you&#8221; looks at her, and deferring to her
just as much as if she had been famous or wealthy, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
praising her to lead up to attempted caresses, while she
sat in judgment on the proceedings, with a queenly
&#8220;I&#8217;ll-have-to-see-about-this&#8221; sensation, and remarks
made of &#8220;slams&#8221; and retirings to put him on his mettle,
and the feeling of owning the world for a few, high-keyed
hours, until she returned to her bed and the
more level-headed endurance-test at the cafeteria. Her
head was totally empty for a time, and she sang the
popular tunes of the day, in a low, contralto voice, as
she fussed about with her toilette. Then glimpses of
Joe Campbell appeared in her head, and she wondered
whether she would ever marry him. She liked him physically,
and she respected his money-making talents, but
her response toward him was much stronger when he
was with her. His absence seemed to remove a black-art
spell, and to leave in its place doubts and confusions.
Then, beneath all of his good-humors and effulgent
generosities, she divined an insincerity and something
that spoke of shrouded, patiently crouching intentions.
What they were she did not know. Her mind
was not capable of delving into this reaction, and it told
her only that he wasn&#8217;t &#8220;coming out&#8221; with his real self.
Her brother had introduced him to her six months
previous to this night, and since then Campbell had
pursued her in an irregular way, since he frequently
left New York on vaudeville-bookings. She had allowed
him certain physical liberties and had admonished herself
afterwards for being &#8220;too easy,&#8221; but the matter
had rested there, since he had never been remarkably
insistent in his efforts to vanquish her.</p>

<p>When he came up, and airily saluted her, Harry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
and Mabel, who were in the living-room, greeted him
effusively. They considered it an honor that this minor
Broadway favorite, whose name was occasionally in
electric lights, should be so willing to visit them and
&#8220;step out of his class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lo, Joe, still bringin&#8217; down the house?&#8221; asked
Mabel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;The bulls came running
into the place last night, looking for a free-for-all
fight, the clapping was that loud.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mabel and Harry laughed, and Harry said: &#8220;C&#8217;mon,
I bet you coulda heard a maxim-silencer after you got
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the same gun they shoot off when you get
through fighting, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Campbell, with a
solemn look.</p>

<p>&#8220;You win,&#8221; answered Harry, laughing again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got to go now,&#8221; Mabel said. &#8220;Papa
doesn&#8217;t like to be kept waitin&#8217;, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sure and don&#8217;t leave him anything,&#8221; Campbell
replied. &#8220;A girl got expelled from the Flappers&#8217; Union
the other day&mdash;they all got sore at her because she
overlooked a ten-spot in the upper vest-pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talkin&#8217; to the president of the Union&mdash;don&#8217;t
be funny,&#8221; answered Mabel.</p>

<p>Blanche joined in the laughter now and then&mdash;Campbell&#8217;s
humor was hard to resist. A stocky man of medium
height, whose feet were always tapping the floor
as though they had a light itch to be dancing, he rarely
ever departed from the bon-mots that constituted his
chief stock-in-trade. His mind was intelligent in worldly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
ways, and a blank otherwise, but he was quite aware
of his ignorances and careful not to expose them. He
had a long, narrow face, with a slanting nose, mobile
lips, and a twinkling, lazy cruelty in his eyes. His
thick brown hair was burnished and pasted down on his
head, and he wore the latest, loose-trousered clothes,
in shades of gray and brown, with multicolored scarves,
and a diamond ring on one of his fingers. He was a
coarse sensualist grown careless from many feminine
captures, and he had held back in Blanche&#8217;s regard
from the feeling that she would &#8220;have to come to him
first.&#8221; Still, he was becoming aware of an increasing
urge toward her, moved by something in her face and
figure that &#8220;hit it off just right.&#8221; She wasn&#8217;t nearly as
pretty as tens of Broadway girls whom he knew, but
she had an unspoiled swerve and sturdiness that attracted
him, and in addition, he felt that she knew much
more than many other women of his acquaintance&mdash;that
she was not quite as shallow, or as palpably scheming,
as most of his retinue were.</p>

<p>He left the apartment with her, and they hailed a
taxicab and were driven to his cabaret off Upper
Broadway. His turn only came on at eleven o&#8217;clock
when the after-theater crowd poured into the place, and
he sat with Blanche at one of the tables, and endlessly
greeted his &#8220;friends,&#8221; and adulterated glasses of ginger-ale
with the contents of a silver flask carried in
his hip-pocket.</p>

<p>The Golden Mill was a resplendent, baroque cabaret,
with a large, electrically lit windmill, made of gold
silk stretched over a framework, standing over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
stage. The jazz-band sat just below the stage, between
the carpeted runways on which the performers descended
to the dance floor. Men and women, half of
them in evening clothes, chattered and laughed at the
surrounding tables, with a macabre heartiness that
sometimes lessened to betrayals of the underlying
dullness.</p>

<p>The whisky began to knock about in Blanche&#8217;s heart
to a cruelly victorious feeling&mdash;Campbell thought
he was so darn smart, didn&#8217;t he? Well, he&#8217;d have to
go some to get her, just the same. Girls were always
falling for a celebrity of his kind, and she&#8217;d treat him
to a novelty. Still, he made her laugh and forget
the rest of her world, and she didn&#8217;t mind if he caressed
her to a certain extent (not too much and not too little).</p>

<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;know, you&#8217;re a royal-flush to me,&#8221; said Campbell.
&#8220;I&#8217;d win the pot with you, any day in the year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll win the air &#8217;f you get too gay,&#8221; she answered,
merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now is that nice?&#8221; he queried, in tones of mock-reproach.
&#8220;Daddy&#8217;ll do anything for you&mdash;anything
you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not taking things from men this year,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she smart&mdash;keeps count of the years &#8217;n&#8217; everything,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll stop counting when you get
to be thirty, old dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the place where you stopped?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Campbell winced secretly&mdash;he was thirty-five and
not particularly elated about it. Blanche always talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
better under the influence of liquor&mdash;it loosened her
tongue and unearthed an effervescence in her mind:
keen as far as it went.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take that knife away, Annette;&mdash;it&#8217;s killing me,&#8221;
he responded, in quavering, melodramatic tones.</p>

<p>Blanche took another sip from her highball.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;y&#8217;know, I may get crazy some time and ask you
to marry me,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad&mdash;it must be worrying you a lot,&#8221;
answered Blanche. &#8220;I never lose my head that way,
so look out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But really, I&#8217;m strong for you,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all in fun most of the time with me, but you&#8217;re at the
top of the list.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to bet on your meaning it,&#8221; said Blanche,
a bit more softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it, you couldn&#8217;t get any odds,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>He chucked her under the chin and she slapped his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What nervous ha-ands you&#8217;ve got,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, act as though you didn&#8217;t like it,&#8221; he retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the best thing I do,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>They continued the bantering, with the occasional
interruption of a fox-trot, until his &#8220;turn&#8221; came on,
when he left her with an acquaintance of his&mdash;a harmless,
hero-worshiping chorus man in a dark suit,
whose ruddy, regular-featured face had a look that
was perilously near to a pout. Then Campbell appeared
in white duck trousers, a dark blue coat, black shoes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and a panama-straw hat, and did clog-dances, and
sang in a hard tenor voice, at the head of a bare-legged
chorus dressed in very short boyish trousers
of red, and indigo low-necked vests, and gaudy caps
slanting on their heads. He was a nimble dancer and
had a powerful voice, and could have risen to a point
near the head of his profession, if laziness and undue
dissipation had not held him down. When his act had
finished and he had cleaned the make-up from his
face, he returned to the table and remained there with
Blanche until 2 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> After they left the place they
entered a cab and he said: &#8220;What d&#8217;you say to coming
up to my joint for a while&mdash;I&#8217;m harmless, girlie,
I won&#8217;t make you cry on mother&#8217;s shoulder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are, and you&#8217;re going to stay that way,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;C&#8217;mon now, tell James to drive over to
Ninth Avenue, old dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a grimace and did as she requested. He&#8217;d
get her yet, no fear, but there was no need for hurrying.
It was always a fatal move to expostulate with a
woman at such a juncture. Again, she wasn&#8217;t important
enough to <i>him</i> for any come-downs.</p>

<p>In the taxicab, he hugged and kissed her, and
though she made little resistance, an alertness contended
against the liquor-fumes in her head and
counseled her to &#8220;look out.&#8221; As they stood in the hallway
of her building he became a trifle bolder, and she
was passive for a while and then stopped him. It
wasn&#8217;t easy to hold out against him, and she had
barely been able to check the rising dizziness within
her, but she simply couldn&#8217;t let him win her as lightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
as this. She had not drunk sufficiently to reach a gigglingly
helpless mood, although everything <i>did</i> seem
to be jovially unimportant, and a dislike of him rose
within her. He was too confident, he was. She&#8217;d teach
him a lesson, she would, in spite of all of his physical
appeal and his pleasant nerviness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a little too fast&mdash;I can&#8217;t keep up with you,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Besides, I&#8217;m getting the willies standing
here all the time. Be a good boy now, and let me go
upstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, girlie&mdash;game&#8217;s over,&#8221; he replied, gracefully
taking his defeat. &#8220;How about next Saturday&mdash;eight
&#8217;r so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That suits, I&#8217;ll be on deck,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He kissed her again and went out to the waiting
taxicab. As she entered her room she had a droopy,
misty feeling. Oh, well, another man turned down&mdash;what
did <i>she</i> get out of it, anyway? It was funny, you
wanted to and you didn&#8217;t want to at the same time.
She blinked at herself in the mirror, and then turned
out the light and went to sleep.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late spring evening extracted lights from the
twilight on Ninth Avenue, like some pacing conjurer
producing tiny, molten rabbits from his trailing, unseen
sleeves. Blanche walked along the street, on her
way home from the cafeteria, and her high heels
scuffed on the dirty cement sidewalk with a weary
evenness. It was all right to say that sitting on a stool
all day rested your legs, but the energy that went from
your arms and head drew its penalty from all of your
body. That cafeteria was finally &#8220;getting on her
nerves&#8221;&mdash;the place had changed proprietors a few
weeks before, and the new owner, a furtive-faced man
of thirty, who considered himself to be an invincible
Don Juan, always hovered about Blanche&#8217;s stand as
much as he could and continually touched her in ways
that made it hard for her to conceal her ire. She had
run out of all of her tactfully laughing withdrawals,
and momentary submissions when the gesture was not
&#8220;too raw,&#8221; and the situation had reached a straining-point.
It would not have been so bad if he had been
good-looking, or if he had sought to lavish gifts upon
her, but here he was a man with a long nose and a
spindly body, making advances to her because she
was an employee of his at twenty-three a week&mdash;the
nerve of him! She would quit the place to-morrow
if he tried another thing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>A year had passed since her last spring night with
Campbell at The Golden Mill, and she was now a
little over twenty-one. Her figure had grown less bottom-heavy,
and her bosom had curved out a bit, and
her face was more resolved and inquiring beneath the
many ignorances that still remained. A deeper, half
hopeless question had crept into her bluish-gray eyes&mdash;an
untutored I&#8217;d-like-to-know-what-it&#8217;s-all-about look&mdash;and
her wide lips had come together more closely
and lost some of their loose thoughtlessness. Very
dimly, she had even commenced to see flaws and
credulities in her hitherto uninspected family, especially
in her father and her brother Harry, whose endless
strut and domineering words had become more of
a palpable bluff to her. Yet, at the same time, she still
accepted her environs without much anger or revolt,
because, after all, they were real, and near-at-hand,
and seemingly permanent, and because they still held
nightly escapes, and laughing conquests at parties, and
dance halls, and cabarets. The only one possibility of
a change was marriage, and she dreaded this loophole
because it meant being tied down to one man
and losing the delicious sense of juggling several men
to the stress of her whims. At times she toyed with
the dream of becoming the mistress of a wealthy and
at least endurable man&mdash;plenty of women &#8220;got away
with it,&#8221; and what was hindering her?&mdash;but it never
more than flitted through her mind because her life
had always pounded into her the fact that a girl had
to be &#8220;respectable&#8221; at all costs, had to cling to an
indignant pose of keeping men at arm&#8217;s length, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
she could look the world in the face with the glad
knowledge that it was unaware of her &#8220;personal&#8221; relentings
and sins. Otherwise, the girl definitely cut
herself off from all safeguards and reassurances, and
was regarded with contemptuous smiles, and lightly
spoken of. Again, Blanche had just insight enough
to see what the outcome might be if she lived with
such a man or allowed him to maintain an apartment
for her&mdash;to see a hint of the querulous boredoms and
the eventual separation that would ensue unless she
was really &#8220;crazy&#8221; about the man. Of course, she
merely translated it into the statement that she was
not &#8220;cut out&#8221; for such a life.</p>

<p>During the past year, Campbell had been away
twice on long vaudeville tours, and while he was in
New York, her refusals to succumb to him had piqued
him to a point where he called her up at much longer
intervals. What the devil&mdash;he wasn&#8217;t so &#8220;hard up&#8221;
that he had to chase after a cafeteria cashier who was
probably merely intent on getting a &#8220;good time&#8221; out
of him. He could not quite dismiss her from his
mind&mdash;she had a proud twist to her which he liked
in spite of himself, and his vanity always made him
believe that he would eventually subdue her&mdash;and the
impulse to see her again came back to him during his
weariest moods&mdash;after an unusually pronounced jag,
for instance, when he was &#8220;sore at the world&#8221; and
when his head throbbed heavily, for at such times she
always beckoned to him as a fresher and less solved
feminine variation.</p>

<p>Blanche&#8217;s attitude toward him had narrowed down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
to a sentence which she had once said to herself: &#8220;&#8217;F
he ever asks me to marry him, maybe I will, maybe,
but he&#8217;s not going to get me like he does other girls,
not &#8217;f he was the Prince uh Wales himself!&#8221; During
the past year she had been more steadily in the company
of Rosenberg&mdash;he was a necessity to her because
he &#8220;knew more&#8221; than the other men in her life
and could assist the feeble stirrings and problems that
were beginning to spring up in her mind. He was still
unattractive to her in a physical way&mdash;a very bright,
good boy, but not the broad-chested, wise and yet
tender man who constituted her hazy ideal&mdash;but she
had permitted him embraces of greater intimacy, out
of the feeling that it wasn&#8217;t right to take so much from
him and give him nothing in return, although she refrained
from any semblance of a full surrender. He
frequently loaned her books, through which she
stumbled with amusement and awe&mdash;she could not
understand most of what they said (it sure was &#8220;bughouse&#8221;),
but when he sought to explain it to her it
grew a bit clearer, and she had glimpses of men and
women in the novels, who lived more freely and searchingly
than she did, and who saw and spoke of &#8220;all
sorts of strange things&#8221; that she had never dreamt
of&mdash;com-plex-es, and inhibishuns, and hunting for bee-oo-ty,
and boldly telling life how double-faced it was,
and living your own life with a laugh at the objections
of other people, and always looking for something
that stood behind something else. They formed themselves
into perplexing lures that could never be quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
banished from her mind, and became &#8220;stronger&#8221; when
she was in her &#8220;bluest&#8221; moods.</p>

<p>Rosenberg had found another girl&mdash;a blonde, slim
chatterer, who tried to write poetry between her labors
as a stenographer, and worshiped his &#8220;won-der-ful
brain,&#8221; but although this girl had become his mistress,
he never regarded her with more than a flattered satisfaction
and still saw Blanche once a week. He could
not rid himself of the hope that Blanche might finally
love him and marry him, and the other girl&#8217;s glib
professions of culture and creative aspiration were
never as appealing as Blanche&#8217;s stumbling and honest
questions. He saw &#8220;something big&#8221; in Blanche and
wanted to extract it from her and bask in its warm
emancipations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Blanche entered the living-room of her home
she found that Harry and her father were in her bedroom,
engaging in a highly secret confab with another
man. Still resenting her day at the cafeteria, and vexed
at this invasion of her private domain, she burst into
anger before Philip and Mabel, who were seated at
the table and waiting for the mother to bring the
supper in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, what right&#8217;ve they to go in my room?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;Think I want some fella to see my slip-ons &#8217;n&#8217;
things hanging around, and maybe sitting on my bed?
I&#8217;m not going to stand for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush up, don&#8217;t let them hear you,&#8221; said Mabel.
&#8220;I know how you feel, sure, but then it don&#8217;t happen
ev&#8217;ry night. They got something up their sleeves, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
they don&#8217;t even want the resta us to hear about it.
I don&#8217;t see why Harry and pa can&#8217;t trust their own
fam&#8217;ly, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re cooking up something about Harry&#8217;s next
scrap,&#8221; said Philip. &#8220;He&#8217;s in there with Bill Rainey,
and Rainey&#8217;s managing this here Young Thomas, the
kid Harry&#8217;s gonna fight Friday night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll stand it once, but they&#8217;d better not pull
it off again,&#8221; Blanche responded, as she removed her
hat and her spring coat. &#8220;My room&#8217;s my own place
and I don&#8217;t want any strange men looking it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her anger had gone down to a quieter sullenness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Blan, get off the high perch,&#8221; Philip
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all be rolling in money if the thing comes
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;B&#8217;lieve me, Harry&#8217;s going to get into trouble yet
with all this crooked stuff of his,&#8221; Blanche replied.
&#8220;He can&#8217;t even fight on the level any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t blame Harry one bit,&#8221; Mabel said.
&#8220;He&#8217;s just got to play the old game, that&#8217;s all. He
won his las&#8217; bout hands down and they went and give
the verdict to the other fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t be a goody-goody and come out on top
in this burg,&#8221; Philip said, moodily. &#8220;I don&#8217;t b&#8217;lieve
in stealing &#8217;r holding anybody up, but just the same
you&#8217;ve got to be as tricky as the other side, I&#8217;m telling
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s always the line around here, but I&#8217;m not
so sure about it,&#8221; Blanche answered. &#8220;There&#8217;s plenty
of people that get by &#8217;cause they can do things better&#8217;n
other people&mdash;&#8217;cause they&#8217;ve got brains in their heads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
and not a lotta excuses. &#8217;F ev&#8217;rybody was dishonest
all the time, they couldn&#8217;t make jails large enough to
hold &#8217;em. I&#8217;m getting tired of all this fake and fake
and fake around here. It looks like a bum excuse
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since when&#8217;ve you become so up&#8217;n the air?&#8221; asked
Mabel. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been listenin&#8217; some more to your
Rosinburgs, &#8217;n Smiths, &#8217;n all the resta them&mdash;fellas
that walk round without a cent in their pockets, &#8217;n&#8217;
tell you how stra-aight they are, &#8217;n&#8217; talk like they
owned the earth. They give me a pain in the back.
Harry&#8217;s tryin&#8217; to make some real money so we c&#8217;n all
move outa this shack here, but <i>you</i> never give him
any credit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have it your own way,&#8221; Blanche replied, with a
light disgust. &#8220;You won&#8217;t talk like that &#8217;f the p&#8217;lice
ever come up here looking for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m always afraid of,&#8221; said the mother,
who had come in from the kitchen. &#8220;I get turribul
dreams all the time, turribul, an&#8217; I c&#8217;n always see your
father an&#8217; Harry sittin&#8217; in jail. I&#8217;ve always said it&#8217;s
no use bein&#8217; dishonest, no use. It&#8217;s not the right way
uh actin&#8217;, it&#8217;s not, an&#8217; you always get punished for it.
I&#8217;d much rather live just like we are, plain an&#8217; decint-like,
an&#8217; not be worryin&#8217; all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how you feel &#8217;bout it, ma,&#8221; said Blanche,
patting her mother&#8217;s shoulder and stroking her hair,
&#8220;but there&#8217;s no use in saying anything. Try and tell
something to Harry and pa&mdash;just try!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, ma, don&#8217;t be so foolish,&#8221; Mabel said, with
affection and condescending pity mingled, as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
pinched her mother&#8217;s cheek. &#8220;&#8217;F you went round like
I do, an&#8217; saw what was goin&#8217; on, you wouldn&#8217;t be so
worried. Why, there&#8217;s fellas gettin&#8217; away with murder
all the time, an&#8217; nobody touches them. Big ones, too,
the bigges&#8217; they&#8217;ve got in this burg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think ma&#8217;s right, in a way,&#8221; said Philip,
cautiously, &#8220;but she don&#8217;t know what Harry&#8217;s up
against. You can&#8217;t be straight in this scrapping game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s I that always tried to raise all of you to be
honest an&#8217; good&mdash;it&#8217;s no fault uh mine, it&#8217;s not,&#8221; his
mother said, mournfully, as she returned to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The door of Blanche&#8217;s room opened and the two
Palmers emerged with Rainey, the rival manager.
Rainey was a tall, beefy man with a paunch, who
wore an immaculate suit of brown checks and sported
a gray derby hat and a heavy gold chain on his white
linen vest. He was almost totally bald, and his
smoothly ruddy face had the look of a politician
who had just kissed an unusually homely infant, in
the interest of his election. He uttered a few brightly
bovine compliments to the women and then departed,
after a last whispered talk with the father outside of
the apartment door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, what&#8217;s the idea of keepin&#8217; us outside?&#8221; asked
Mabel, peevishly, after her father had returned. &#8220;You
oughta know we&#8217;re safe, you ought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you don&#8217;t know won&#8217;t hurt you none,&#8221; her
father answered, rubbing a finger over his thick lips.
&#8220;Anybody&#8217;ll start blabbin&#8217; when he gets a little booze
in him&mdash;&#8217;specially a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, we know what it&#8217;s all about,&#8221; said Philip.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
&#8220;They&#8217;re pointing Thomas f&#8217;r a go with the champion,
and Harry&#8217;s one guy <i>he</i> can&#8217;t beat, an&#8217; he knows it.
What&#8217;s Rainey going to hand out f&#8217;r Harry&#8217;s putting
the wraps on, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, talk about somethin&#8217; else,&#8221; Harry said,
surlily.</p>

<p>He was a bit ashamed of his r&ocirc;le in the affair&mdash;not
from a sense of guilt but because it was a refutation
of his two-fisted supremacy&mdash;and a bit childishly fearful
that the &#8220;frame-up&#8221; would be discovered if any
one, even a member of his family, conversed on the
subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;You people sure hate to mind your own business,&#8221;
he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, lay off,&#8221; said the father. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
havin&#8217; thousands nex&#8217; week, &#8217;f ev&#8217;rythin&#8217; goes right&mdash;I&#8217;ll
tell yuh that much&mdash;but I don&#8217;t want none of yuh
to start blah-blahin&#8217; all over the place. You girls
wanna keep a close mouth, d&#8217;yuh hear me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hush up, you never give us a chance to say
anythin&#8217;&mdash;you&#8217;re always gabbin&#8217; yourself,&#8221; Mabel
said, petulantly, as she went into her room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet both of you get into a peck of trouble before
you&#8217;re through, but it&#8217;s not my funeral,&#8221; said
Blanche, in a spirit of weary indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop croakin&#8217; all the time, will yuh,&#8221; answered
Harry. &#8220;You talk like you was anxious f&#8217;r us to get
in bad, you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s drop it&mdash;you never pay any attention to
what I say,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m just looking on&mdash;don&#8217;t
mind me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;Well, see that yuh don&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; but look,&#8221; her
father admonished. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been havin&#8217; too damn
much to say, these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blanche repressed her irritation and retired to prepare
for her night&#8217;s engagement. She was to meet a
boy named Fred Roper at the corner drug store, and
hints of coming gayety strove to dispel her darker
feelings. She&#8217;d get away from her family some time,
even if she had to wind up by marrying a hunchback
with one eye, never fear, but in the meantime there
was nothing that she could do. Almost unconsciously,
she had begun to classify the members of her family in
general ways that were far from complimentary. Her
mother was a weak, abused woman; her father was
brainless, and conceited, and bossy; Harry was an ill-tempered
bully and gangster; Mabel thought of nothing
but deceiving men and landing a wealthy one; and
Phil was afraid of his shadow, and never taking sides.
Still, they were <i>her</i> family, and it was necessary to
&#8220;stick up&#8221; for them&mdash;a great deal to other people and
even a little to herself&mdash;and in spite of their faults they
<i>did</i> love each other, and they <i>were</i> generous to each
other, and, after all, they were no worse than most
of the people in the world, as far as she could see.
She would always be loyal to them, sure, but she did
want to get off by herself, and be independent, and not
bear the brunt of their orders, and displeasures, and
knaveries, and to achieve this she would probably
have to pay the penalty of marrying some man whom
she did not love, but who could comfortably provide
for her. What could she do herself&mdash;she had no particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
talent or ability (she was getting wise to that),
and it seemed to be a toss-up between working like a
Turk and doing more as she pleased in a home of her
own. She would never accept any large sums of money
from her family, even if her brother&#8217;s dishonest
schemes should succeed, because she would never be
able to feel right about it&mdash;she didn&#8217;t want money that
was &#8220;dirty&#8221; and not her own.</p>

<p>Her mood was unduly reckless as she walked down
Ninth Avenue to meet her &#8220;boy-friend,&#8221; for she had a
reaction to &#8220;forget the whole thing&#8221; for the night, at
least. In her light brown coat, thinly trimmed with
cheap white rabbit-fur at the bottom and top, and her
short black and lavender cr&ecirc;pe-de-chine dress, and
the round, gray hat snugly fitting over her bobbed
hair, she had the self-contained, jauntily ordinary look
of scores of other girls tripping down the street. Her
escort of the evening, Fred Roper, was a pimply-faced,
stocky youth, with sandy hair and lascivious eyes. He
dressed in expensive gray-checked suits, and wore
a narrow-brimmed, black derby hat, and regarded himself
as one of the Beau Brummells of the neighborhood.
He worked on and off as a clerk in a Ninth Avenue
cigar store, but his main passion and source of revenue
was playing the races, and his financial state varied
from hundreds of dollars on one week to being &#8220;broke&#8221;
and borrowing money on the next. On this night he
had &#8220;cleaned up&#8221; on a ten-to-one shot at Belmont
Park, and he had the truculent swagger of the successful
and not yet hardened gambler, who feels that
he is the darling of chance and need only lift a finger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
to cow anything in the world. Blanche considered him
to be an aimless fool&mdash;one of the hordes of bozoes who
were always trying to get something for nothing&mdash;but
since he was willing to spend money freely for her
entertainment, she saw no reason for refusing to accompany
him now and then. Also, he was a good
dancer, and so far had never sought to do more than
kiss her&mdash;a contact which always had to be endured
as a payment for your evening&#8217;s fun. She knew, of
course, that he was &#8220;laying for her,&#8221; and would sooner
or later attempt to seduce her, but that was the element
of lurking risk that prevented such occurrences
from becoming too stale and peaceful&mdash;it gave you the
watchful tingle, and the sought-after feeling, that
established your feminine importance, even though
you disdained the man in question and had no intention
of responding to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lo, Blanche, how&#8217;s the girlie?&#8221; he asked, when she
had walked up to him at the drug-store entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine as silk,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>They stepped to the curb-stone and looked for an
empty taxicab among those that rolled by.</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;you wanna do to-night?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s see, I guess I&#8217;d better leave you car-fare,&#8221;
said Blanche, impudently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t laugh to-night, my lip hurts,&#8221; he responded.
&#8220;I raked in a coupla hundred on the fifth race to-day,
so don&#8217;t let that part of it worry you none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about a show, and then the Breauville afterwards?&#8221;
asked Blanche.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re on,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;You&#8217;ll meet a lotta guys
before you find one&#8217;s loose as I am, girlie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know&mdash;you&#8217;re a peach, Fred,&#8221; she answered, putting
a note of cajoling praise in her voice.</p>

<p>They rode in a cab to a Broadway theater, where
he purchased the best orchestra seats. The show was
one of those musical revues&mdash;&#8220;The Strolling Models
of 1925&#8221;&mdash;where fully endowed, and slenderly semi-chubby,
chorus girls revealed everything except the
extreme middle portion of their anatomies, and pranced
and kicked about the stage, with a manufactured
blitheness and a perfect cohesion; and where male and
female dancers pounded, leapt, and whirled, like inhumanly
nimble and secretly bored manikins; and
where the scenes were rococo or minutely simple&mdash;multicolored
Chinese scenes, Oriental harem scenes,
streets on the Bowery, Russian peasant festivals; and
where the music and songs were either sweetly languorous
or full of a rattling, tattling sensuality. The
music had a precarious charm, a charm that could not
bear much reiteration but just failed to be obvious at
a first hearing.</p>

<p>Blanche sat, transported, and sorry that she had to
return to her partner between the scenes. This was
the life&mdash;throwing up your head and winking an eye
at all invitations, like you had a first mortgage on the
earth! She envied the girls on the stage, even though
she knew something of the labors and uncertainties attached
to their profession. How she wished that she,
too, could do something different, and get applauded for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
it, and lose the buried sense that often recurred to
her.</p>

<p>After the show she went with Roper to the Club
Breauville, a private hang-out off upper Broadway.
The place was plastered with frescoes and decorations
in gilt, red, and purple, and had a jazz-orchestra of
ten men. It prided itself upon its air of gleeful informality&mdash;a
spirit of natural good-fellowship&mdash;although
you divined that all of the uproar was doing its
best to hide the passage of money, and a less humorous
sensual game. Theatrical celebrities were hailed at the
tables and asked to make speeches, or give impromptu
performances, and people spoke to each other without
an introduction, and a stout hostess in a black and
silver jet evening gown wandered among the tables
and made witty remarks to everybody, and never lost
her &#8220;I&#8217;m-doing-it-to-keep-you-amused&#8221; mien. As
Blanche and Roper followed the head waiter to a
table, the hostess, who had chemically yellowed,
abundant hair, and a round, fake-babyish face, was
bandying words with a group of tall, rakish men in
tuxedoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you hear the latest?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;They&#8217;re going
to give all the chorines a machine and a diamond
bracelet to keep them honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rockefeller&#8217;s donating a million to the cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pass that pipe around and we&#8217;ll all take a whiff,&#8221;
answered one of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you the needle instead&mdash;I sold the pipe
to a stock-broker this morning,&#8221; she answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>The man laughed at this jibe at their profession,
and the hostess turned to another table.</p>

<p>Champagne was sold at fifteen dollars a bottle, and
Roper spent his money lavishly, in the effort to impress
Blanche. When the second bottle came she
drank sparingly&mdash;you grew too darn careless if you
drank too much, and then you frankly &#8220;bawled out&#8221;
the fellow with you, or let him take too many liberties.
Sometimes the matter passed out of your control and
you became merrily hazy about everything, but you
had to fight against such an ending. Roper drank
freely and passed into an inebriated condition that
was sullen and hilarious at different times. This girl
would have to be good to him to-night&mdash;he had played
around with her long enough&mdash;but he would have to
laugh it off for a few hours, until his chance came.</p>

<p>As they rode away in a cab, he kissed her, and she
made no remonstrances. It was all part of the system&mdash;a
kiss or two at the start of the evening, and
allowing the man to hug you a little too closely sometimes,
while you were dancing, and then some more
kisses during the ride home, with a few &#8220;Don&#8217;t, please
don&#8217;ts&#8221; thrown in to provide the proper touch of objection.
Then Roper became more daringly insistent,
and she spoke indignantly over an inner sigh. Here
it was again, the old finale.</p>

<p>&#8220;You musn&#8217;t do that to me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
like you well enough for that, Fred. I mean it. I&#8217;m
not a bad sport, and I&#8217;m willing to go so far, but I
won&#8217;t give in to a fellow &#8217;less I really care for him.
That&#8217;s the way I&#8217;m made.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Roper&#8217;s drunkenness gave him an irresistible anger&mdash;if
this girl thought he was a &#8220;sucker&#8221; he&#8217;d soon correct
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re gonna come across with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
jes&#8217; as good&#8217;s any other fellow, &#8217;n&#8217; I&#8217;ve been treatin&#8217;
you white, an&#8217; you know it. What&#8217;s the idea, stringin&#8217;
me along like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;F you can&#8217;t talk decent to me I&#8217;ll leave the cab,&#8221;
she replied, really aggravated this time. &#8220;I never
promised you anything, and &#8217;f you wanted to take me
out, that was up to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment, caution contended against Roper&#8217;s
drunkenness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, can&#8217;t you be nice to me?&#8221; he asked, trying
to resume his overtures. &#8220;You know I&#8217;m crazy &#8217;bout
you, you know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be like you want me to,&#8221; she answered,
as she pushed him away.</p>

<p>This time, a rage took full possession of his muddled
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I stop the cab an&#8217; let you get out,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You&#8217;re too damn stuck-up to suit me, an&#8217; I won&#8217;t
stand f&#8217;r any more of it, see? You&#8217;re nothin&#8217; but a
lousy gold-digger, you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>A cool sneer rose up within Blanche&mdash;she&#8217;d &#8220;call
his bluff&#8221; this time, and show him that he couldn&#8217;t
insult <i>her</i> with impunity. She tapped on the glass panel
and stopped the cab. Roper tried to detain her, but she
shook off his hands and stepped out to the pavement.
The cab driver looked on with a quizzical ennui&mdash;this
thing happened in his cab at least once every night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>&#8220;C&#8217;m on back, Blanche, I&#8217;ll be good,&#8221; Roper cried,
but she ignored him and strode down the street.</p>

<p>He followed her in the cab to the next corner, repeating
his entreaties and not quite daring to leap
after her, but the presence of an inquisitive policeman
caused him to abandon the chase, with a final oath.
As she walked home, Blanche had a feeling of relief
and of self-reproach. She had taught this fellow a
lesson, but what was the sense of such happenings?
She couldn&#8217;t dismiss a twinge of guilt at having taken
his entertainment and then rejected him, but what
could a girl do&mdash;sit at home all the time and watch the
walls? Oh, darn, it was all a mess, all right.</p>

<p>On the following morning at the cafeteria, she had
a heavy head and a scarcely veiled sulkiness. If Harrison,
the proprietor, started anything now, she&#8217;d have
to quit her job&mdash;it was about time that men found out
that they couldn&#8217;t treat her as though she were a bag
of oatmeal! Nothing occurred until the middle of
the afternoon, when Harrison, a tall, thin man with a
long nose and blinking eyes beneath his curly brown
hair, hung around her desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wanna go somewheres to-night?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks, I&#8217;ve got &#8217;n engagement,&#8221; she replied,
trying to make her voice a little cordial.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;re always turnin&#8217; me down,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, don&#8217;t I look good to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re all right,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t
help it &#8217;f I&#8217;m usually dated up. There&#8217;s a lot of men
in this town, you&#8217;d be surprised, and there&#8217;s only seven
days in the week, y&#8217; know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stall around so much,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come on,
let&#8217;s go to a show to-night, what do you say? You
know you like me, Blanche, sure you do. You just
wanted to see how often I&#8217;d ask you, that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He accompanied his words by placing a hand upon
one of her hips, and this time her endurance fled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m leaving to-night&mdash;you&#8217;ll have to find another
cashier,&#8221; she said, coolly. &#8220;Try all of this stuff on
some other girl and see how she likes it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment, with a heavy incredulity,
and then broke into wrath&mdash;this girl thought
she was better than he was, eh?</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t leave too soon to suit me,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You act like you was Queen of Hoboken, &#8217;r something
like that! I&#8217;ll pay you off to-night, and good riddance!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;F I had your conceit I&#8217;d think I was a queen, all
right,&#8221; she replied, as she went on punching the
register.</p>

<p>&#8220;You give me a pain,&#8221; he retorted, as he walked
away.</p>

<p>She looked after him with an immense relief. Thank
the Lord, this was over at last.</p>

<p>As she walked to her home that night, she felt an
emboldened mood, as though she had asserted herself
for the first time in her life. When she broke the news
to Mabel, who was sitting in the living-room, her sister
was sympathetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a darn sight better off away from that place,&#8221;
Mabel said. &#8220;Stop workin&#8217; for a while an&#8217; just step out,
Blan. You&#8217;ve got a rest comin&#8217; to you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say I have,&#8221; answered Blanche.</p>

<p>For the next week Blanche hung around the apartment,
and enjoyed the luxury of rising at ten in the
morning and losing the old feeling of drowsy, meek
bondage, and went to moving-picture theaters or read
some of Rosenberg&#8217;s books during the afternoon, and
romped about with men every other night, but at the
end of the week, the relish in her freedom disappeared,
and a nervous weariness took its place. She wanted
to be doing something again, and to feel that she was
earning the right to her nightly pleasures, and to rid
herself of the sense that she &#8220;didn&#8217;t amount to anything&#8221;
and was just hugging her bed to forget about
it. To be sure, work was disagreeable and often exhausting,
but if you had no other gifts, what else could
you do? That phrase that Rosenberg was always
using&mdash;&#8220;expressing yourself&#8221;&mdash;it kind of got under
your skin. Why couldn&#8217;t she write things, or be an
actress, or learn something and teach it to other people,
like the men and women whom she read of in the
borrowed novels? Well, maybe she would some day,
if she ever found out just how to go about it. She
was still a mere girl and she didn&#8217;t intend to be kept
down forever. In the meantime, working could prevent
her from getting &#8220;too blue&#8221; about everything&mdash;a
brisk distraction which was the only one within her
reach.</p>

<p>She secured a position in a beauty parlor, giving
&#8220;waves&#8221; to the hair of young women fidgeting over
their allurements, and <i>pass&eacute;</i> women rescuing the vanished
or vanishing charm, and on the evening of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
first working day she met Rosenberg at their usual
street-corner rendezvous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s just have a talk and not go anywheres to-night,&#8221;
she said, as they walked down the glittering
hardness of Forty-second Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you,&#8221; he answered, with an elation upon
his narrow face.</p>

<p>When a girl didn&#8217;t want you to spend anything on
her, and yet desired to be with you, it was an exquisitely
promising sign, and perhaps Blanche had
begun to fall in love with him. They sat on one of
the stone benches in front of the Public Library building
and beneath one of the huge carved lions that
guard its portals, and they looked out at Fifth
Avenue, with its endless stream of crawling, shiny,
smoothly soulless automobiles and busses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at all those machines, going somewhere and
nowhere at the same time,&#8221; he said, dreamily. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
they all look important though, all rolling along in two
directions, and still they&#8217;re just filled with all kinds of
people hunting for an evening&#8217;s fun, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#8217;pose they are, what of it?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got to get some amusement outa life, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if that&#8217;s all you&#8217;re after then you&#8217;re just like
an animal,&#8221; he answered, importantly. &#8220;D&#8217;you know,
sometimes I wonder why people have heads&mdash;they
hardly ever use them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I&#8217;ve been using my head some
lately but I don&#8217;t seem to be getting anywheres,&#8221; she
said, dully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>&#8220;Maybe you don&#8217;t see where you ought to go,&#8221; he
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cert&#8217;nly don&#8217;t,&#8221; she responded. &#8220;&#8217;Less a girl
knows how to do something big, she hasn&#8217;t got a
chance. Gee, I wish I was clever and could put it
over, like some girls do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try to write, or go to school and
study something?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got it in you,
Blanche, I know you have, but you just don&#8217;t believe
in yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me&mdash;write?&#8221; she queried, with a laugh. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be foolish, Lou. I can&#8217;t even spell most words
straight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could, &#8217;f you put yourself to it,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;Piles of times you say something with a lot of meaning
to it, piles of times, but you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s in
you, Blanche. You need to be pushed along and to
get some confidence in yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t like to believe you, huh?&#8221; she
asked, wistfully. &#8220;I feel like I could do things when
you talk to me, Lou, and then afterwards it all goes
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent for a while, and then she said:
&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s forget about it. We&#8217;re sitting here like a
couple of dopes and letting off a lot of easy talking.
Talking, that&#8217;s about all I&#8217;m good for, I guess. Let&#8217;s
take a bus ride and see the Avenue.&#8221;</p>

<p>They boarded one of the green, lumbering busses
and sat on the uncovered top. He curved an arm
around her waist, and she made no objections. He
had a peaceful, heartening influence on her, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
wondered whether it might not be best to marry him,
in spite of the fact that he was physically negative to
her. He might help her to make something out of herself.
But no, it never worked out. You had to be
thrilled and light-headed and upside-down when a
man touched you, and if you weren&#8217;t, you&#8217;d soon get
tired of having him near you, no matter how much
you liked to hear him talk, and how encouraging he
was.</p>

<p>When they lingered in the hallway of her building,
she let his embraces become more determined, for the
first time in many months, moved by her troubled
compassion for him. Then she stopped him, and gave
him a sorrowful look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to love you, Lou&mdash;I&#8217;m not kidding,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you a lot nearer to it now than you ever
were?&#8221; he asked, eagerly. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little bit, maybe,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You&#8217;re a
good boy, Lou, you are, and I&#8217;m always going to be
straight with you. I&#8217;ll never tell you nothing but the
truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>They kissed again, and after they had arranged to
meet on the following Monday he walked down the
hallway, wondering whether he should dare to hope,
and hoping in spite of his wondering.</p>

<p>When Blanche returned from her work, on the next
evening, she immediately perceived the downcast looks
on the faces of her mother, Philip, and Mabel, who
were seated around the living-room table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s this, anyway&mdash;&#8217;n Irish wake?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217; this mornin&#8217;, you&#8217;d have
been that worried,&#8221; her mother replied, dolefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, don&#8217;t you read the papers?&#8221; asked Mabel.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve got it on the second page of the Herald to-night,
an&#8217; the Courier, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry&#8217;s been called up before the Boxing Commission,&#8221;
said Philip. &#8220;He and pa went down this
afternoon, and we&#8217;re expecting them back any minnit
now. There musta been a leak somewhere &#8217;bout that
fake scrap he pulled night before last. They&#8217;re after
him hot and heavy, and the Club wouldn&#8217;t pay him off
to-day, and I think Rainey&#8217;s double-crossed him in
the bargain. It looks bad all right for poor Harry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I know this was going to happen,&#8221; Blanche
exclaimed. &#8220;I did think he&#8217;d get away with it once &#8217;r
twice, though, before they caught him. You&#8217;ve got to
have brains &#8217;f you want to be a crook in this world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, stop this I-told-yuh-so line,&#8221; answered Mabel.
&#8220;Harry was only trying to look out for the rest of us,
and I&#8217;m darn sorry for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not,&#8221; Blanche replied, determinedly.
&#8220;He needed something to take the swelled head out
of him, he did, and I&#8217;ll say it even &#8217;f he is my own
brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only hope it&#8217;ll make all of you listen more to
your ma,&#8221; said Mrs. Palmer. &#8220;There&#8217;s never no good
in tryin&#8217; to make money dishonest-like. It&#8217;s happy
I&#8217;ll feel &#8217;f Harry&#8217;ll only go to work now, an&#8217; give up
alla that fightin&#8217; and bummin&#8217; around like he does.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;Well, Harry&#8217;s not down yet, I&#8217;m saying,&#8221; Philip
interposed. &#8220;B&#8217;lieve me, he&#8217;ll fix the guys that did
him dirty, and he&#8217;ll do a good job of it, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, and get into jail for doing it,&#8221; said Blanche,
as she walked into her room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like you wished it on him,&#8221; Mabel called
after her, irritably.</p>

<p>As Blanche changed to a kimono, she tried to feel
sympathetic toward Harry, but she could not down her
sneaking satisfaction at his misfortune. Somehow, it
was difficult to engender affection toward this rough-neck,
never-seeing, cocksure brother of hers. Of
course, a man wasn&#8217;t a man unless he used his fists
and his voice with a hard efficiency, but Harry carried
his masculinity to an overbearing extreme, and never
paid any attention to your side of the question, and
seemed to have a meanness&mdash;a go-to-hell spirit&mdash;which
could instantly be awakened by the slightest opposition.
His dishonesty didn&#8217;t annoy her particularly,
but she disliked the lame excuses that he always made
for it. If he had been an out-and-out hold-up man, she
would have respected him far more. Oh, well, he was
her brother after all, and maybe this happening would
make him more subdued and considerate. Funny,
she and her family would be disgraced now, and yet,
if he hadn&#8217;t been found out, they&#8217;d still be holding
their heads high in the air. &#8220;Getting away with it&#8221;&mdash;that
was all people ever seemed to care about.</p>

<p>She heard the voice of her father and brother, and
went out to the living-room. They sat slumped down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
in chairs, with their hands in their pockets, and
scowled down at the linoleum-covered floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It gets my goat, that bastard on the Commish,
Murvaney, tellin&#8217; me &#8216;Y&#8217;r a dis-gra-ace to the ring,
Mis-ter Palmer.&#8217; Didn&#8217;t he wink his eye and give
Callahan a clean bill when they had all that fuss about
the welter champ fight? Sure he did! I&#8217;d like to have
the coin they slipped him f&#8217;r that little stunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use uh beefin&#8217;&mdash;we&#8217;re in f&#8217;r it,&#8221; his
father answered, dully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they do to Harry?&#8221; Blanche asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;They went an&#8217; barred him from the ring indef&#8217;nitely,
the skunks,&#8221; her father answered. &#8220;Thomas an&#8217; Rainey
only got three months, an&#8217; there&#8217;s somethin&#8217; rotten
somewhere. &#8217;F we find out they flimflammed us we&#8217;ll
make &#8217;em wish they hadn&#8217;t! A guy they call Carnavan
come down an&#8217; swore he&#8217;d listened to Rainey an&#8217; me
fix it all up in the Club on the night of the fight. I
saw him hangin&#8217; around that night, I saw him, but
Rainey said he was a good friend uh his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those two guys&#8217;ll be in the hospital before the
end uh the week,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Watch what I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what good will it do you &#8217;f you beat them up?&#8221;
asked Blanche. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to rub it in, Harry, but
you&#8217;ll get into worse trouble than this, &#8217;f you don&#8217;t tone
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your mouth shut, that&#8217;s all I want from you,&#8221;
Harry answered. &#8220;You&#8217;re too good to live, you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think it&#8217;s a darn shame, Harry,&#8221; said Mabel,
putting an arm around his shoulders.</p>

<p>He squeezed her chin, and his scowl lessened a bit&mdash;he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
had a &#8220;soft spot&#8221; for Mabel. She knew that you
couldn&#8217;t get along in this world without being as rotten
as the next fellow was, and she appreciated his generosity
and his manly qualities, and knew that he was
usually the victim of bad luck and that he hardly ever
received a &#8220;square deal.&#8221; Blanche, on the other hand,
was a coward, always trying to preach at him, and
she thought that she was better than he was, and she
needed to be &#8220;taken down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the one in this fam&#8217;ly I&#8217;m strong for,&#8221; he
said to Mabel. &#8220;You c&#8217;n have my las&#8217; dime any time
you want it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; Mabel replied. &#8220;Blanche is gettin&#8217;
too stuck-up these days, an&#8217; she thinks she knows it
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;d better lay offa me,&#8221; he said, ominously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You just can&#8217;t stand it when any one tells you
you&#8217;re wrong,&#8221; Blanche retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about me, Harry, you know I&#8217;m always with
you,&#8221; Philip said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re all right, but you need more guts,&#8221;
Harry answered. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know enough to go out
an&#8217; get what&#8217;s comin&#8217; to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;F I was a scrapper like you, maybe I would,&#8221;
said Philip. &#8220;I don&#8217;t take any sass from anybody &#8217;f
I can help it, you know that, Harry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not right f&#8217;r you an&#8217; Blanche to be always
fightin&#8217; like this,&#8221; said Mrs. Palmer, turning to Harry.
&#8220;It&#8217;s I that wish you&#8217;d be nice to each other, like a
brother an&#8217; sister should. I don&#8217;t think you done right,
I don&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s no good pitchin&#8217; into you now. Maybe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
you&#8217;ll be a good, honest boy from now on, maybe you
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean well, ma, but you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m
up against,&#8221; Harry answered, as he patted her head
in a clumsy, reluctant way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make me sick, Kate,&#8221; the father broke in.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you an&#8217; me work hard f&#8217;r years, didn&#8217;t we,
an&#8217; what did we get out of it, what did we get? Nothin&#8217;
but trouble, I&#8217;ll say! You an&#8217; Blanche leave Harry
alone, &#8217;r you&#8217;ll hear from me. He got a bum deal this
time, but he&#8217;ll be out on top, &#8217;fore it&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, I&#8217;ve got confidence in Harry,&#8221; said Philip,
giving his brother a look of respect tempered with
more secret annoyance. &#8220;He knows how to handle
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want my own boy to get behind the
bars, an&#8217; he will &#8217;f he don&#8217;t behave himself more,&#8221; Mrs.
Palmer said, in a weakly lamenting voice, as she
shuffled back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Blanche, who had no engagement for the night, went
to a neighboring moving-picture show and saw a film
called &#8220;Nell of the Yukon,&#8221; in which a dimpled
statuesque actress named Dorothy Darling&mdash;a lady in
her desperately preserved, early thirties&mdash;smiled, and
frowned, and struggled, without subtlety but with
much animal abandonment wasted on the impossible
tale. She played the part of a speckled but not quite
approachable dance-hall girl in a mining camp in
Alaska, and she was in love with a handsome young
gambler who had incurred the enmity of the saloon
and dance-hall proprietor. Of course, the gambler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
was the only honest one in the place, and, of course,
he protected her from the proprietor, whose intentions
toward her were, alas, horribly immoral, and, of course,
the gambler was also loved by another jealous dance-hall
girl, who became the tool of the unscrupulous
proprietor. The second girl trapped the gambler in
her room and, after he had gently repulsed her pleadings,
delivered him to the ambuscade of the villainous
proprietor and his cohorts. He was about to be slain
by this oddly hesitant and delaying villain when Nell
of the Yukon rescued him, at the head of a band of
his mining-camp friends.</p>

<p>As Blanche looked on at the film, she had an excited
interest that sometimes lessened to a sense of the
absurd. It <i>was</i> &#8220;sort uh silly,&#8221; to be sure, especially
that scene where Nell fought against the proprietor,
in her room, and suffered no casualties except the
tearing of the upper part of her waist, and the loosening
of her hair. No girl ever got off that easy when
a strapping fellow had her cornered and was out to
do her wrong! But still, the story was a glimpse into
another fabricated world, far more enticing than her
own, and in her eagerness to forget the immediate
facts in her life, Blanche devoured the colossal unreality
of the film with only an occasional qualm.
Afterwards, as she walked down Ninth Avenue, she
had an odd mood&mdash;too tired to be discontented, and
yet carrying the suggestion that life was purposeless
and that there was &#8220;nothing much to it.&#8221; The mood
stayed with her as she rested prone on the bed in her
little room.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the twenties, years slip by with the flimsy rapidity
of soap-bubbles blown from the breath of time, unless
the person experiencing them has found an unusually
cloistered or passionless existence. As Blanche
sat in the Beauty Parlor where she worked as a hair-curler,
she remembered that she was twenty-two and
that her birthday was only twenty-four hours distant.</p>

<p>The year which had elapsed since her brother&#8217;s expulsion
as a prize-fighter seemed to be little more than
a crowded and instructive month. As she sat in the
Parlor, during an afternoon&#8217;s pause between patrons,
she said to herself: &#8220;Gee, here I am, already twenty-two!
I&#8217;ll be &#8217;n old dame before I know it. It&#8217;s enough
to give you the jimjams, it is.&#8221; Something that was
not wisdom but rather an engrossed search for wisdom
rested on the smooth plumpness of her face.
Again, a light within her eyes came near to the quality
of self-possessed skepticism and shifted against the
survival of former hesitations and faiths. Life to her
was no longer a conforming welter of sexual advances
and retreats, with moments of self-disapproval bearing
the indistinct desire &#8220;to get somewhere&#8221;&mdash;thoughts
and emotions had snapped within her; problems were
assuming a more unmistakable shape; the people in
life were displaying to her more indisputable virtues
and faults; and a spirit of revolt was simply waiting for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
some proper climax. Her past year of argument and
contact with Rosenberg had given her a more assured
tongue and a more informed head. The books that he
had supplied her with had now crystallized to specific
inducements&mdash;tales about men and women whose lives
were brave, or distressed, pursuits of truth, and an ever
keener knowledge of each other, and a sexual freedom
that was not merely the dodging of lust to an eventual
marriage ceremony, and a dislike for the shams and
kowtowings of other men and women. Frequently,
she invited the scoffing of her family by remaining at
home and reading some novel until well after midnight,
with her eyes never leaving the pages. Her sister and
brothers, and her parents, felt that she was getting
&#8220;queer in the dome,&#8221; wasting her time like that when
she might have been picking up some fellow with
serious intentions, or enjoying herself, and though she
still went out with men three or four nights of every
week, the family were beginning to fear that she was
not a &#8220;regular&#8221; girl and that silly, unwomanly ideas
had gotten into her head. In their opinion twenty-two
was the age at which a woman should either be married
or be moving toward that end, and they couldn&#8217;t understand
her apathy in this matter. They cast most of
the blame on Rosenberg&mdash;that dopey mut that she
was always afraid to bring around had evidently turned
her against her family and filled her with junk from
the foolish books he loaned her.</p>

<p>Even her mother had begged her to stop going with
him and had complained: &#8220;It&#8217;s you that&#8217;s not me own
sweet girl any more. You oughta stop traipsin&#8217; around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
with that Jew boy, you oughta. He won&#8217;t never marry
you, and it&#8217;s I that wouldn&#8217;t let you, anyways. He&#8217;s
got no money and he&#8217;s not right in his head, he&#8217;s not!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry had threatened to &#8220;beat up&#8221; Rosenberg, if
he ever saw him, and her father had railed at her, but
she had seemed to look upon their objections as a huge
joke, which had angered them all the more but left
them powerless to do anything except to lock her in
her room at night&mdash;an expedient that could hardly
be tried on a twenty-two-year-old daughter who earned
her own living and could leave the family roof whenever
she pleased.</p>

<p>On her own part, Blanche had treated their railings
with a perverse resentment. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go on seeing him
just to spite them&mdash;who&#8217;re they to boss me around,&#8221;
she had said to herself. In reality, she had lost much
of her old respect for Rosenberg&#8217;s mind and verbal
talents, and she was beginning to see flaws in his
make-up.</p>

<p>&#8220;He never does anything but talk&mdash;he&#8217;s a wonder
there,&#8221; she had said to herself once. &#8220;He takes it all
out in wind. I&#8217;ll bet you he&#8217;ll be working in that
library for the rest of his life, &#8217;r in some other place
just like it. &#8217;N&#8217; again, he always says he&#8217;s going to
write big things, but I never see him doing it. I&#8217;d like
to meet a fellow that&#8217;s doing something&mdash;making a
name for himself. Gee, &#8217;f I could ever run across
one of those nov&#8217;lists, for instance. That man, Ronald
Urban, who wrote Through The Fields&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
it be all to the mustard to talk to him! He could tell
me all kinds of things I&#8217;ve never dreamt of.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>Still, she continued to see Rosenberg because he was
the best prospect at hand, and because she pitied his
longings for her, and to show her family that she could
not be intimidated.</p>

<p>Harry was still barred from the ring, and the family
had lapsed back to its old tilts with poverty. Both
Blanche and Philip had to give part of their earnings
toward the maintenance of the apartment, as well as
Mabel, who had gone to work as a dress-model for a
wholesale cloak-and-suit firm. She pronounced it
&#8220;cluck &#8217;n soot,&#8221; and affected a great disdain for her
environs and her Jewish employers, but she was not at
all averse to dining and dancing with some of the more
prosperous buyers who frequented her place. Harry
had become more of a wastrel, and did little except
loaf around during the day, with an occasional bootlegging
venture and sojourns with women, while the
father loitered about poolrooms and complained of his
son&#8217;s persecution, or sat in poker and pinochle games.</p>

<p>As Blanche lolled in the Beauty Parlor, tinkering
with her nails, the image of Joe Campbell was in her
head. He had ignored her for six months and then
had bobbed up again on the previous day, and she had
an engagement with him for the coming night. &#8220;It&#8217;s
no use&mdash;I can&#8217;t get you out of my head,&#8221; he had told
her over the telephone. &#8220;I stopped seeing you because
I thought you were playing me for a sucker, but go
right ahead, girlie, I&#8217;ll bite again. You&#8217;re deuces wild
and the sky for a limit with me!&#8221; &#8220;You didn&#8217;t get
hoarse telling me that for the last few months,&#8221; she
had replied, amused and a little flattered. &#8220;Sure not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
I was trying to forget you,&#8221; he had responded. &#8220;It
can&#8217;t be done, little girl. Come on now, let daddy act
like a millionaire to-night&mdash;he&#8217;s good that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she had mentioned his call to her family,
they had all urged her to &#8220;make a play for him&#8221; and
angle for a proposal of marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be nuts about you &#8217;r else he wouldn&#8217;t
always come back for more,&#8221; Mabel had said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bet you&#8217;re always freezin&#8217; him out, that&#8217;s the trouble.
You&#8217;ll be a fool &#8217;f you don&#8217;t try to land him this time.
He&#8217;s loaded with jack, and he&#8217;s got a rep, and he&#8217;s
not so bad-lookin&#8217; at that. What more d&#8217;you want,
I&#8217;d like to know&mdash;you&#8217;re no Ziegfeld Follies girl yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, as she sat and polished her finger-nails,
Blanche wondered whether it might not be best to
marry Campbell after all. Most of his past glamor
to her had been rubbed away, and she saw him as a
second-rate actor, always laughing to hide what he
wanted to get from a girl, and drinking and spending
his money because he wanted people to believe that
he was much more important than he really was, and
caring nothing for the &#8220;fine&#8221; part of life which she
had begun to realize&mdash;books, and paintings, and such
things. Still, if she married him he would give her a
leisure and an independence in which she could find
out whether anything was in her or not, and whether
she was gifted for something better than marcelling
hair or punching registers. Then she would be able
to sit most of the day and just read and think, or
maybe go to some school and learn something, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
meet new kinds of people. How could she ever make
something out of herself if she had to work hard every
day, and give half of her limited dollars to her family,
and listen to their naggings and pesterings? Of course,
she did not love Campbell, and the thought of continuous
physical relations with him was not as pleasant
as it had once been&mdash;somehow, when you began to
&#8220;see through&#8221; a man&#8217;s blusterings and boastings, his
hands and his kisses lost part of their thrill&mdash;but still,
he <i>was</i> physically agreeable to her, and it might be
idle to hope for more than that from any man. He
wouldn&#8217;t talk about the new things that she was interested
in, or sympathize with her desires for knowledge
and expression, but when, oh, when, would she
ever find a man who had these responses? Such men
lived and moved in a different world, and were hardly
likely to meet, or to care for, a questioning Beauty
Parlor girl&mdash;they could easily procure women who
were more their equals. Besides, it was silly to sit and
mope around and wait for your &#8220;ideal&#8221; to arrive. You
might wind up by becoming a dull old maid, with
nothing accomplished.</p>

<p>The one thing that counseled against marriage to
Campbell was her unfounded but instinctive distrust
of him. She could never rid herself of the feeling that
he was secretly cruel and heartless, and that there was
something &#8220;phony&#8221; about all of his smiles and laughters,
and that he was not nearly as intelligent as he
seemed to be, but knew how to manipulate an all-seeing
pose.</p>

<p>The Beauty Parlor was a sweetly smirking, pink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
and whitish, overdraped place, trying so hard to look
femininely dainty and insipidly refined and still preserve
something of a business-like air. Cream-colored
satin panels were nailed to the walls and pink rosebud
arrangements shaded all of the electric lights except
the green-shaded, practical ones placed beside
the tables and the chairs where the work was done.
There were Persian rugs on the hardwood floor, and
amateurishly piquant batiks, and the reek of cheap
incense and dryly dizzy perfume was in the air. Outside
of three prosaic, ordinary barber-chairs, the place
had several dressing-tables with long mirrors, enameled
in shades of ivory and pink with thin, curved
legs. Bottles of perfume and jars of paste and powder
were scattered over the place, and many framed photographs
of actresses were on the walls, most of them
signed: &#8220;With affection (or with regards) to my dear
friend, Madame Jaurette&#8221; (some of them had cost
Madame a nice penny). These picture-testimonials
had a potent effect upon the Beauty Parlor&#8217;s clientele,
owing to the humorous misconception on the part of
many women that actresses and society queens alone
are acquainted with the mysteries and abracadabras
of remaining physically young, beautiful, and unwrinkled.
Photographs of society women were much
more difficult for Madame to procure&mdash;money was of
no avail in their case, ah, <i>mais non</i>!&mdash;but she did have
one of Mrs. Frederick Van Armen, one of the reigning
upper-hostesses of the day, which she had secured
after a year of plotting, and of pleading notes.</p>

<p>The entire shop had an air of sex running to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
artificial restoration place to repair the ravages of time,
or to add an irresistible exterior to its youth, but there
was something hopeless and thickly pathetic attached
to the atmosphere. It was sex that had lost its self-confidence
and its unashamed hungers&mdash;sex that hunted
for tiny glosses and protections, and had a partly mercenary
fear and precision in all of its movements.</p>

<p>Blanche&#8217;s thoughts of Campbell were interrupted
by the advent of the proprietress, Madame Jaurette,
and a young patroness. Madame was fat, and too
short for her weight, but through the use of brassieres,
bodices, reducing exercises, and diets, she had kept
her curves from emulating a circus side-show effect.
It was a strain on her nerves, however, and she had
that persecuted but uncomplaining look on her face.
Like a great many middle-class, nearly middle-aged
French women, with very moderate educations, she
was a preposterous mixture of dense cupidities and
romantic sentiments, and while the cupidities had their
way with her most of the time, they were always apt
to be knocked galley-west by some gentleman with
an aquiline nose, or the destitution of some weeping
girl. She had a round, almost handsome face, with
the wretched hint of a double chin that was never
allowed to go any further, and bobbed, black hair&mdash;it
didn&#8217;t become her but it had to be mutilated for
business reasons&mdash;and she dressed in dark, lacy, expensive
gowns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Ma&#8217;m&#8217;selle Palmaire, you will take so good
care of Mees White, she is vairy fine lady,&#8221; she
babbled. &#8220;Mees White, she always have Nanette to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
feex her hair, but Nanette she is here no more.
Ma&#8217;m&#8217;selle Palmaire, she is really ex-pert, Mees White.
She will geeve you, what you call it?&mdash;the curl that
won&#8217; come off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;F I&#8217;m so good, why don&#8217;t you raise my wages
once in a while,&#8221; Blanche thought to herself, but she
said: &#8220;Sure, I guess I know my work all right. I&#8217;ll
do the best I can for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The patroness was a slim girl with a disproportionately
plump bosom, a dumbly child-like, near-pretty
face, and a great shock of blonde, bobbed hair. As
Blanche heated the curling-irons, the other girl said:
&#8220;It&#8217;s just the hardest thing to keep my hair wavy. It
never does last more than two or three days. I&#8217;ll spend
a fortune on it before I&#8217;m through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get a permanent wave&mdash;it&#8217;s cheaper
in the end,&#8221; Blanche answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m never able to afford it when I do get the
impulse, and then I might want it straight again any
time. It&#8217;s all so much a question of what you&#8217;re wearing
and how you feel, you know. D&#8217;you think I look
good in curls?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blanche had no opinion whatever on the subject, but
she replied: &#8220;Yes, indeed, I think they go well with
your face.&#8221; Patronesses, to her, were simply blanks
to be dealt with in rotation, unless they exhibited an
ill-temper or an impatience. A spell of silence came as
Blanche bent to her task, and then the other girl said:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you get tired of working all day in this stuffy
place? I know I could never stand it myself.&#8221; Blanche
was used to this question&mdash;women who tried hard to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
show an interest in the beauty-parlor workers but
rarely ever really felt it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no worse than lots of other things,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to earn my living some way. I
won&#8217;t be here all my life though, believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation continued in this casual strain,
with neither woman caring much about what the
other said, but with both desiring to lessen the tedium
of an hour. Two-thirds of all the words that human
beings talk to each other are merely unaffected protections
and tilts against an impending boredom.</p>

<p>When Blanche came home from work that night,
the members of her family were seated at the supper-table.
After she joined them they began to twit her
about her approaching engagement with Campbell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gonna make him buy the license, Blanche?&#8221;
Harry asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a dog license,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fine crack to make against a fellow like
Joe,&#8221; Harry replied. &#8220;You&#8217;re not good enough f&#8217;r him,
&#8217;f you ask <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;F you give me one of your hankies I&#8217;ll cry about
it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Maybe that&#8217;ll suit you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry looked at her dubiously&mdash;it sure was hard
to &#8220;get her goat&#8221; these days.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re gettin&#8217; sillier ev&#8217;ry day,&#8221; Mabel said to
her sister. &#8220;You&#8217;ll never find another chance like Joe
Campbell&mdash;they don&#8217;t grow round on bushes. S&#8217;pose
you&#8217;d rather sit all night &#8217;n&#8217; read one of those no-ovuls
uh yours. It&#8217;s hard to figure you out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place he hasn&#8217;t asked me to marry him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
yet,&#8221; Blanche answered, &#8220;and besides, I don&#8217;t see why
all of you have to butt into my affairs so much. I never
tell any of you people what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t forget, I&#8217;m your father, and I&#8217;m gonna
have somethin&#8217; to say &#8217;bout who you hitch up with,&#8221;
Will Palmer said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody&#8217;ll stop you from saying it, but I&#8217;m no
good at being bossed around,&#8221; she retorted coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see &#8217;bout that, we&#8217;ll see,&#8221; her father responded
with a heavy emphasis.</p>

<p>This daughter of his was becoming too high-handed,
and he would probably have to use harsh measures to
her for her own good, but as long as the matter remained
one of verbal exchanges there was nothing
that he could do about it. Just let her start something,
though!</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all jes&#8217; tryin&#8217; to look out f&#8217;r you, Blanie
dear,&#8221; her mother said. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t get so uppity
about it, you shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can take care of myself&mdash;I&#8217;ve had to do it long
enough, ma,&#8221; Blanche responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll, I&#8217;m with you all the time, and that&#8217;s no
lie,&#8221; Philip said.</p>

<p>He did not understand Blanche to any great extent,
but he liked her independence (&#8220;spunk&#8221;) because it
spoke to the similar feeling within himself which he
was too cowardly to express.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re about the only one in this fam&#8217;ly who
leaves me alone,&#8221; Blanche answered, with a little
dolorous affection.</p>

<p>She knew that Philip was weak and hedging but she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
was grateful for his lack of hard interference and pitied
his spineless spirit.</p>

<p>As she dressed to meet Campbell she had a don&#8217;t-care,
tired-out mood. Let them all talk their heads
off&mdash;they couldn&#8217;t prevent <i>her</i> from doing what she
wanted to do.</p>

<p>When Campbell came up, the rest of her family
had departed, with the exception of her mother, who
greeted him with a timid cordiality. How she wished
that her daughter would marry this good-natured,
prosperous man! She herself would have been much
better off if she had been more prudent in her youth
and not so much concerned with this &#8220;lovin&#8217; and
mushin&#8217;&#8221; thing. Why, any woman could get to lovin&#8217;
a man if he took care of her, and acted kind and true,
and didn&#8217;t bother with other women, and had a nice,
jolly nature. Of course, Campbell <i>did</i> go around with a
fast, booze-lapping crowd&mdash;she knew what those
Broadway people were, but leave it to Blanche to tame
him down if she married him. Well, maybe Blanche
would come to her senses before it was too late.</p>

<p>When they reached the street, Campbell said to
Blanche: &#8220;What&#8217;s on your mind, to-night, old dear?
You&#8217;ve said about six words since I came up. You
haven&#8217;t gone back on me, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel much like gabbing to-night,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;I guess I won&#8217;t be very entertaining to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just be yourself, that&#8217;s all I want,&#8221; he said, as he
squeezed her arm. He sensed that something might
be &#8220;going wrong&#8221; with her at home, and after they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
had entered a cab he asked: &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, your
family been razzing you any?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re always doing that,&#8221; she responded.
&#8220;They&#8217;re great ones on telling me what I should do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you make a break?&#8221; he queried. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
always thought you were a fool to stay in that rotten
dump of yours. It&#8217;s no place for a girl with any class
to be living in, you know that. You could get a couple
of rooms of your own and do as you please, and sit
on the top of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had an idle sympathy for her, and he felt that
she would be much more accessible if she were removed
from the guardian eyes of her family. Funny,
how he couldn&#8217;t get this girl out of his mind. She had
a &#8220;thoroughbred&#8221; touch, a high-headed, brave, exclusive
something that he had rarely found in women
and could scarcely define. It wasn&#8217;t her looks and she
certainly wasn&#8217;t particularly talented in any way&mdash;it
was a straightness in conduct and word, and an untouched,
defiant essence that seemed to cling to the
physical part of her. Some women were like that&mdash;their
affairs with men never left any impress upon
them. Guess they never really gave in to any man&mdash;that
was it.... Should he ever ask this girl to
marry him? Marriage&mdash;brr! Wasn&#8217;t he still paying
alimony on the first one that he had contracted? No,
he&#8217;d be willing to live with Blanche and give other
women &#8220;the air,&#8221; for some time at least, but no more
marrying for him. Even this would be quite an important
concession for a man of his kind, who could
have his pick of pretty girls every night. His first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
wife had attracted him just as Blanche did, and what
had happened? Everything sweet and snug for the
first six months, and then a first quarrel because she
caught him kissing a girl in his show&mdash;nothing but
handcuffs and a prison cell ever satisfied <i>them</i>&mdash;and
then more quarrels about where they should eat, and
what kind of ties he ought to buy, and a dozen more
trivial frictions. And money&mdash;two hundred a week for
her expenses got to be like two dollars in her estimation.
Then he had felt the gradual letting down of his
desire for her&mdash;she had not become less attractive but
less imperative and more a matter of pleasant convenience.
He had returned to unfaithfulness, after
drunken parties&mdash;how could any man help it?&mdash;and
he&#8217;d certainly never forget the cheap, blah-blahing
night when she had burst into a hotel room, with two
private detectives, and found him with a woman. No
more of that kind of joke for him.</p>

<p>These thoughts occurred to him irregularly as he
talked to Blanche in the cab, and afterwards as they
sat in a corner of The Golden Mill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a simp to work like a nigger all the time,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s it bring you, anyway? Three dimes
and a crook in your pretty back, that&#8217;s about all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy for you to talk,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Tell me
how I&#8217;d ever get along without working?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep you up any time you say,&#8221; he responded,
caressing her hand that rested on the table, &#8220;and don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;m spoofing you, either. I&#8217;ll give you anything
you want, and no strings tied to it. I mean it. Don&#8217;t
think I hand this spiel around ev&#8217;ry night! You&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
had me going ever since I first saw you&mdash;you&#8217;ve got the
class and I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him meditatively&mdash;it would be necessary
to &#8220;call him down&#8221; for this open proposal,
but&mdash;just saying it to herself&mdash;why shouldn&#8217;t she be
supported by a man? How would she ever get a
breathing spell otherwise?</p>

<p>&#8220;When I take money from any man I&#8217;m going to
be married to him first,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;and don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;m giving you any hints, either. &#8217;F I wanted to be
free and easy with men, I&#8217;ve had plenty of chances
before this&mdash;plenty. I hate to work at something I
don&#8217;t care much for, sure, ev&#8217;ry girl does, but it&#8217;s
better than living with some fellow till he gets tired
of you and then passing on to some one else. They&#8217;ll
never play baseball with yours truly &#8217;f she can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was divided between admiration for her &#8220;spunk&#8221;
and candor, and a suspicion that she might be testing
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stop dealing from the bottom of the deck,&#8221; he
said, slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known you for two years, now,
Blanche, and it&#8217;s time that we came to some understanding.
This loving stuff&#8217;s all apple-sauce to me&mdash;you
always think you&#8217;re nuts about a girl till she
falls for you, and then you change your eyesight.
I&#8217;ve had one bum marriage in my life, and I never
was fond of castor-oil and carbolic acid on the same
spoon. If you&#8217;ll hook up with me, old girl, I&#8217;ll treat
you white, but I can&#8217;t hand out any signed testimonials
about how long it&#8217;ll last, for you &#8217;r me. What&#8217;s the
use of all this worrying about next week and next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
year? It&#8217;s like not sitting down to your meal, &#8217;cause
you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re going to have for dessert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the proposition?&#8221; she asked, surprised
at her own lack of indignation, and liking his unveiled
attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get you a swell apartment up in the West
Seventies,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and you can put up a bluff at
studying something&mdash;music &#8217;r acting &#8217;r something like
that&mdash;just a stall to keep your folks in the dark. I&#8217;ll
get a wealthy dame I know to take an interest in
you, see? She&#8217;ll be the blind. She&#8217;s a good sport and
she&#8217;ll do anything for me. You&#8217;ll be known as a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i>
of hers, and your family&#8217;ll never know I&#8217;m putting
up the coin. Why, it&#8217;s done ev&#8217;ry day in the
year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, I&#8217;m to be your miss-tress, like they say in the
novels,&#8221; Blanche answered, with a struggle of irritation
and tired assent going on within her. &#8220;I suppose I
ought to bawl you out for your nerve, but I won&#8217;t take
the trouble. I&#8217;d like to <i>really</i> study something, and get
somewheres, but I&#8217;m not so sure I want to take it
like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, don&#8217;t you like my style?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not so bad &#8217;s far as you go,&#8221; she replied,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t happen to be in love with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You know you like to
be with me&mdash;that&#8217;s what counts. Most of this love
stuff&#8217;s a lot of hokum, that&#8217;s all. I never saw a
couple in my life that stayed crazy about each other
for more than two years, and that&#8217;s a world&#8217;s record.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
If they stick to each other after that it&#8217;s because they
haven&#8217;t got nerve enough to make a break, &#8217;r for
the sake of their kid, &#8217;r a hundred other bum reasons.
But they&#8217;ve lost the first, big kick ev&#8217;ry time&mdash;don&#8217;t
fool yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;&#8217;F a
girl finds a man that loves her for what she is&mdash;her
ways of acting and talking&mdash;I don&#8217;t see why they
can&#8217;t get along even &#8217;f they do get tired of hugging
and kissing all the time. They&#8217;ve got to have the same
kind of minds, that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We-ell, how&#8217;s my mi-ind diff&#8217;rent from yours?&#8221; he
asked, amused and not quite comprehending (she sure
had acquired a bunch of fancy ideas since his last
meeting with her).</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way, you don&#8217;t like to read much, real
good books, I mean,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;and you never go
to swell symf&#8217;ny concerts where they play beautiful
music, and you don&#8217;t care for paintings and statues
and things like that. I never thought much of them
myself, once upon a time, but I&#8217;m beginning to get
wise to what I&#8217;ve been missing. I mean it. I&#8217;ve been
going around for a long time with a fellow that likes
those things, and I&#8217;m not as dumb&#8217;s I used to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campbell laughed inwardly&mdash;doggone if she hadn&#8217;t
become &#8220;highbrow&#8221; since their last time together!
This was an interesting, though absurd, turn of affairs.
She had probably been mixing with some writer or
painter, who had stuffed her head with &#8220;a-artistic&#8221;
poppycock, which she didn&#8217;t understand herself, but
which she valued because it was her idea of something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
grand and elegant. Girls like Blanche were often
weathercocks&mdash;not satisfied with their own lack of
talent and ready to be moved by any outburst of novel
and impressive hot air that came along. Well, it would
be easy to simulate a response to her new interests
and captivate her in that way, unless the other man
had already captured her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know I don&#8217;t like those things?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never talked much about them because
I never knew they mattered to you. I thought you
believed that this guy, Art, was a second cousin to
artesian wells. How was I to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught the presence of an insincerity in his
glibness.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;F they&#8217;d been first on your mind, you couldn&#8217;t
have helped talking about them,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Anyway,
&#8217;f I ever went to live with you, I&#8217;d never do it
roundabout, like the thing you had in mind. I&#8217;m not
much on lies and hiding things. When I leave home
it&#8217;ll be a clean break, and anybody that doesn&#8217;t like
it&#8217;ll have to mind his own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I only wanted to make it easier for you,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t care whether your family gets
sore, or not, it&#8217;s all the same to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you talk as though I&#8217;d said yes to you,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take so much for granted, Joe. I&#8217;ve
listened to you like a good sport, instead of bawling
you out, but I&#8217;m not going to rush off with you <i>this</i>
week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now, I&#8217;m not trying to force myself on you,&#8221;
he said, soothingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>She <i>was</i> a wary one, and no mistake, but it looked
as though he finally had her on the run, and it was
all a question of whether he cared to exert a little
more patience and persuasiveness in the matter. Of
course, he&#8217;d continue the game&mdash;he had nothing to
lose, and it would be a distinction to have her lovingly
in his arms, and he really liked her defiance and her
immunity from ordinary wiles and blandishments.
She was somebody worth capturing&mdash;no doubt of that.
A degree of cruelty also moved within his reactions.
Just wait till he had her where he wanted her&mdash;he&#8217;d
do a little bossing around himself then, and if she
didn&#8217;t like it....</p>

<p>When they departed from The Golden Mill, the
whisky that she had had played tiddledywinks with
her head, aided by the abrupt change from the heated
cabaret to the cooler street air, and she felt an Oh-give-in-to-him-what&#8217;s-the-dif&#8217;
mood, and her thoughts
grew mumbling and paralyzed. She swayed a bit on the
sidewalk and he put an arm around her waist, to
steady her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Blanche, don&#8217;t pass out on me,&#8221; he said, anxiously.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll go over to my shack now, that&#8217;s a good
girlie. I won&#8217;t eat you up, don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go anywheres ... give my he-ead a rest ...
feels like a rock ... that&#8217;s funny ... like a ro-ock,&#8221; she
answered, mistily.</p>

<p>He hailed a cab, and on the way over to his apartment,
she leaned her head on his shoulder and passed
into a semidrowsy state, while he caressed her with
a careful audacity and smiled to himself. Well, well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Blanche Palmer in the little old net at last&mdash;what a
blessing liquor was, if you kept your own head.</p>

<p>When they reached his apartment&mdash;two ornate, untidy
rooms with mahogany furniture, and signed
theatrical photographs, and an air of cheaply ill-assorted
luxury&mdash;he wanted her to rest upon one of the
couches, but her head had grown a bit clearer by this
time, and admonishings were once more faintly stirring
within it. Where was she? Where?... In Campbell&#8217;s
apartment.... So, he&#8217;d gotten her there at last. Damn,
why was everything trying to revolve around her?
This wouldn&#8217;t do at all.... She must ... must ...
must get herself together. Tra, la, la, what on earth
was the dif&#8217;? It would be nice to let the whole world
go hang for one night, and feel a man&#8217;s body against
hers, and stop all of this fighting and objecting. Sweet,
all right, sweet, but no ... no ... no ... he&#8217;d be getting
her too easy ... and all he wanted was &#8217;nother party
with &#8217;nother girl ... she knew ... and she just didn&#8217;t
love ... oh, love, nothing ... better to feel good and
be yourself ... but she didn&#8217;t trust him and she
wouldn&#8217;t have him ... just wouldn&#8217;t have ... yes, she
would ... no-o ... she&#8217;d simply have to pull herself
together.</p>

<p>She went to the bathroom and closed and locked the
door behind her before he knew what was happening&mdash;he
had been standing in a corner of the room and
confidently slipping into his dressing-robe. Then she
plunged her head into cold water, off and on, for the
next half hour, and found a bottle of smelling-salts
in his medicine cabinet and thrust it against her nostrils,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and loosened her waist. She felt herself growing
steadier, and the mists in her head changed to a swaying
ache in which her thoughts regathered, and her
emotions became sullen and self-contemptuous.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re some boob, you are, letting Joe Campbell
dose you up with booze and get you to come to his
place,&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;He almost put one over
on you this time, you conceited dope. How much respect
would he have for you if he got you this way?
Say, don&#8217;t make me laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of the sick giddiness that still remained
within her, she became morosely determined to leave
the apartment and return to her home. If he tried any
rough stuff, she&#8217;d yell for aid, or break something over
his head. But he wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;he&#8217;d never risk losing
her. He&#8217;d know darn well that if he tried any movie
stunts she&#8217;d never see him again. Well, maybe she
had misjudged him&mdash;maybe he was really in love with
her and too ashamed to admit it. They always put up
that I-don&#8217;t-care-I&#8217;ve-got-a-hundred-others bluff, to impress
a girl. Besides, men always wanted the same
thing, and they shouldn&#8217;t be blamed for that. It was
natural.</p>

<p>During the half hour he had rapped repeatedly on
the door and begged her to come out, and she had
ignored his words. Now she opened the door and
walked slowly into the room. He was mixing a highball,
and he looked up with a placating smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, feel any better now, Blanchie?&#8221; he asked,
casually. &#8220;Sit down and rest it off.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say I do,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m going home,
Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her intently and saw that at least
half of her drunkenness had disappeared. H&#8217;mm, this
was a nice state of affairs. Sweet mamma, he&#8217;d rather
go after a she-fox any day in preference to this girl!
Well, he would have to renew his caresses and cajoleries&mdash;more
carefully this time. He walked up to her
and placed his arms around her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, don&#8217;t leave me flat now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
wild about you, dear, and I mean it. What&#8217;s the use of
stalling around all the time? Hell, life&#8217;s short enough,
and the next morning slaps you in the face just the
same. I&#8217;d marry you in a second if I didn&#8217;t know that
marriage never turns out right. Let&#8217;s be ourselves,
Blanche dear&mdash;let&#8217;s cut out this comedy stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he embraced her his words became more sincere
than their original conception had been&mdash;somehow
transformed by her smooth closeness and his
grudging respect for the note of &#8220;class&#8221; within her.</p>

<p>She tried to thrust him away from her, with wobbly
arms, and said: &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to let me go home, Joe,
I&#8217;m not myself, I&#8217;m not. You wouldn&#8217;t want me to
give in to you just because I&#8217;ve drank too much&mdash;not
if you love me like you say you do. &#8217;F I ever come
to you I don&#8217;t want to be coaxed&mdash;I want to do it
of my own accord, and be glad about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, you&#8217;ve got me up in the air,&#8221; he answered,
trying to embrace her again.</p>

<p>This time she repulsed him with more vigor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see you stop me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;&#8217;F you try
it you&#8217;ll wish you hadn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked to the couch and started to put on her
hat and coat. His mind began to work swiftly, repressing
his impulse to follow her and change it to a battle.
The determination in her voice might not be real&mdash;he
had subdued other girls by resorting to a mingled
physical struggle and pleading at the last moment&mdash;but
he had a hunch that it was genuine in her case. She
was that rare kind of girl who had to be handled with
extreme, inhuman care, and who had a fighting spirit
within her and became sullenly stubborn when she
thought that a man was trying to force himself upon
her. If he controlled himself now, it might give him
the halo of a &#8220;real gentleman&#8221; to her, and then afterwards
she would come to him of her own accord, just
as she had said. He walked up to her and held one
of her hands, gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think I am&mdash;a gorilla &#8217;r something?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;d never try to keep you here against your
will, don&#8217;t be silly. I thought you didn&#8217;t mean it &#8217;r
else I&#8217;d never have acted this way. You&#8217;ve got the
wrong slant on me, Blanche. I&#8217;ll get a cab for you now
and see you home.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him more softly and said: &#8220;Maybe
I have, Joe, maybe. You can&#8217;t be blamed &#8217;f you want
me, but you&#8217;ll just have to wait till I come to you
myself, &#8217;f I ever do.&#8221;</p>

<p>They descended to the street and he rode home
with her. He kissed her lightly, as they stood in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
hallway of her building, and said: &#8220;When can I see
you again, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too dizzy to think &#8217;bout anything now,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;Call me up real soon and we&#8217;ll make a date.&#8221;</p>

<p>She managed to reach her room with no greater
heralding than a collision with a chair in the kitchen,
and after she had undressed and turned out the light,
she pitched herself upon the bed, as though she were
violently greeting a tried and deliciously safe friend.
For a while, fragments of thought eddied through the
growing fog in her head. Hadn&#8217;t she acted like an idiot&mdash;like
one of those movie queens in the pictures, always
struggling around with some man, like they were
ashamed they had bodies? She was alone now&mdash;she&#8217;d
had her way, and she was winding up with nothing,
nothing except another day of hard word at the &#8220;parlor,&#8221;
with a heavy head to carry around. Oh, gee,
where was the man with a big chest, and a handsome
face&mdash;it wouldn&#8217;t have to be pretty, like that of a cake-eater&mdash;and
a complete understanding of all her longings,
and a wonderful mind, and ... her head grew
blank and she fell asleep.</p>

<p>On the next morning she had a virulent headache,
and felt thwarted and taciturn, and was quite certain
that life was a fraud and that the future held nothing
for her. The mood remained with varying intensities,
during the next three days, but the resiliency of youth
slowly drove it away, and on the third night, as she
sat in her room, preparing for a &#8220;date&#8221; with Rosenberg,
she felt quite skittish and intactly hopeful. After
all, they hadn&#8217;t been able to down <i>her</i> yet. She&#8217;d get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
ahead in the world before she was through, and she&#8217;d
find the man that she was looking for, and in the
meantime, Mister Campbell, and Mister Munson, the
stock-broker who had called for her in a limousine on
the night before last&mdash;her birthday&mdash;and Mister
Rosenberg, and all the rest of them, would have to
jig to her tunes. She gave an idle thought to Munson.
He was wealthy, and middle-aged, with a large wart
on his broad nose, and his conversation ... <i>his</i> money,
and <i>his</i> friends, and what <i>he</i> would do for her. Yet,
thousands of girls would simply have jumped at the
chance to marry him.... All of these men were just
makeshifts along the way, until she came across the
man whom she could really love, and where was the
selfishness involved?&mdash;her presence and her talk were
worth just as much as theirs, and if they were not satisfied,
there were no ropes tied to them. She never
ran after <i>them</i>, did she?</p>

<p>Again, she berated herself for having as much as
seriously considered Campbell&#8217;s proposal to live with
her and support her&mdash;in a couple of months at most he
would have turned away from her and sought another
girl, and then what would she have had? A sold-out
feeling, and a wondering where to turn next, and the
whole problem of her life still staring at her. And to
think that she had been on the verge of giving in to
him that night at his apartment! She would have to
stay away from liquor for a while&mdash;it might turn her
into a rank prostitute before she knew what was happening.
A girl only needed one good push to throw
everything to the winds, and she knew her weakness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and would have to be more on guard against it. When
she met a man whom she loved, she&#8217;d be daring and
ardent then and tell the world to go to the devil, without
even worrying about how long it might last, and
not merely because booze had made her feel jolly and
helpless and overheated. At her next meeting with
Campbell she intended to tell him that they could
never be more than pleasant friends to each other.</p>

<p>As for her family, they were a more concrete bug-bear.
She knew that Harry and her father would become
pugnacious if she ever deserted her home without
marrying a man of their choice, but in a pinch, what
could they do except strike her, and if they dared....</p>

<p>She emerged from her room, and Mabel, who was
sharing a newspaper with Harry, said: &#8220;I heard you
come in las&#8217; night, Blan. &#8217;F it wasn&#8217;t five bells I&#8217;ll
eat your gray bonnet. I hope you didn&#8217;t let Joe get
too frisky, though I wouldn&#8217;t blame you much if you
did. Only he won&#8217;t be liable to marry you &#8217;less you
hold him off&mdash;you know how men are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see Joe last night, but don&#8217;t worry, I wasn&#8217;t
born yesterday,&#8221; Blanche answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re gonna meet that Jew sissy uh yours,&#8221;
said Harry. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give him a boxin&#8217; lesson &#8217;f I run into
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all you ever have on your mind,&#8221; Blanche
retorted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that all this fighting of yours
has ever brought you much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, I&#8217;m not through yet,&#8221; he responded,
with an angry look. &#8220;You hate a guy that
doesn&#8217;t let off a lotta cheap gas and wriggle his hips.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>As she left the building to meet Rosenberg at the
corner drug store, two blocks away, she did not notice
that Harry was following her. When she and Rosenberg
had exchanged greetings and were about to cross
the street, she heard her brother&#8217;s voice cry: &#8220;Hey,
wait a minnit!&#8221; and they turned around, and she
asked: &#8220;What do you want, Harry?&#8221;</p>

<p>He ignored her and spoke to Rosenberg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name&#8217;s Rosinburg, huh?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I just
wanna be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; Rosenberg answered, scenting
trouble and wondering what turn it would take.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you keep away from my sister, get me?
You&#8217;ve been fillin&#8217; her head with garbage and turnin&#8217;
her against her own people, you have, and I&#8217;m gonna
put a stop to it. You&#8217;re a Jew-kike besides, an&#8217; you
better stick to your own kind and leave our girls alone,
see? &#8217;F you know what&#8217;s good for you, you&#8217;ll trot
along, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caution and wrath contended within Rosenberg.
This man was a professional fighter and gangster, and
could probably beat him easily in spite of the difference
in their heights, but, by God, he wouldn&#8217;t stand
for that kind of insulting interference.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I&#8217;m a Jew, and I&#8217;m proud of it,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;What gives you the idea that you can order
me around? If Blanche wants to be with me, that&#8217;s
her business and not yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m gonna make it my business,&#8221; Harry retorted,
doubling his fists and stepping closer to Rosenberg.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>Blanche, who had been stunned and then inarticulately
angry at first, glared at Harry&mdash;of all the nerve,
insulting her escort and handing out commands to <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you out of your mind, Harry?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;What do you mean by butting in like this? I&#8217;m not a
baby and I&#8217;ll do exactly as I please, and you might as
well get that into your dumb head!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry still ignored her and said to Rosenberg: &#8220;Are
you gonna beat it &#8217;r not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You notice I&#8217;m still standing here, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
Rosenberg asked, trembling a bit, but holding a lurid
roar in his head, in spite of the sick pain in his breast.</p>

<p>He was in for it&mdash;it couldn&#8217;t be helped.</p>

<p>Harry immediately punched Rosenberg in the jaw
and stomach, in quick succession, and Rosenberg reeled
back but recovered his balance and advanced with a
snarl and wildly swinging arms. They fought around
the sidewalk for the next half minute, while an increasing
circle of men and women gathered silently about
them. The spectators made no effort to interfere, but
watched with that intent, hungrily curious impersonality
that usually possesses city crowds in such a situation.</p>

<p>Blanche stood with a numb fear and a helpless anger
heavy within her, as she nervously twisted her little
white handkerchief and tried to look over the heads of
the spectators. Was there anything in life except
trouble, and browbeating, and every one trying to pull
you a different way ... and that vile brother of hers
... she&#8217;d fix him for this audacity ... poor Rosenberg,
how she had unwittingly lured him into this mess ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
he was more nervy that she had ever given him credit
for ... perhaps Harry was half killing him ... poor,
poor boy.</p>

<p>Rosenberg fought desperately, his courage reviving
to an unnatural fervor beneath the repeated stinging
blows, but Harry was far too swift and strong for him,
and an uppercut to the jaw finally knocked Rosenberg
to his knees. At this juncture some one yelled:
&#8220;Jiggers, here comes a cop!&#8221; The ring of onlookers
broke instantly, and some of them sped around the
corner and walked swiftly down the side street, while
others stood about indecisively. Harry promptly
jumped into a nearby taxicab and was driven away&mdash;he
had done his job and didn&#8217;t mean to get arrested
for it. Blanche hurried to Rosenberg and helped him
to his feet, just as the policeman, with the proverbial
lateness of his kind, strode up to them. Rosenberg&#8217;s
left eye was discolored and a rivulet of blood dropped
from his swollen lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this rumpus about&mdash;where&#8217;s the fellow
that beat you up?&#8221; the policeman asked, loudly.</p>

<p>For a moment, Blanche was about to betray her
brother, but she checked herself&mdash;what good would
it do? Her hand tugged pleadingly at Rosenberg&#8217;s
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were walking along when some enemy of his
came up and hit him,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
who the fellow was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, y&#8217;r escort knows, all right,&#8221; the policeman
said, turning to Rosenberg. &#8220;Who was he, come on,
loosen up.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you &#8217;cause I don&#8217;t want to make any
charges against him,&#8221; Rosenberg answered, slowly.
&#8220;He started it and I had to defend myself, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer turned disgustedly to the sprinkling of
bystanders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did any of you see what happened?&#8221; he demanded.
There was a chorus of &#8220;noes&#8221; and &#8220;not me&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, you always take it in but you get blind afterwards,&#8221;
he said, angrily&mdash;he was a new policeman and
brassily anxious to make arrests and acquire a record.
&#8220;Go on, beat it now, don&#8217;t stand around blocking up
the corner. And you, girlie, you&#8217;d better take him in
this drug store and have his face fixed up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved his club as he dispersed the bystanders.</p>

<p>Blanche helped Rosenberg into the drug store, and
the clerk applied a poultice to Rosenberg&#8217;s eye and
gave him some iodine for his mouth. Blanche felt
an enormous pity for him&mdash;he was physically weak
but he was not a coward, and she wished that she
could love him, for he certainly deserved it. She had
a sense of guilt at having caused him all this pain and
trouble, and she became confused at the impossibility
of making any amends to him. More kisses and huggings?&mdash;they
would only lead him to an eventual disappointment.
Only her love could make him happy,
and that couldn&#8217;t be manufactured, no matter how
much you respected a man. Oh, darn, was there ever
an answer to anything?... One thing was certain,
though&mdash;for his own good she would have to stop seeing
him. Otherwise, she would only continue to lure
him into danger without offering him any reward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>On his own part, Rosenberg felt a determined resentment&mdash;if
he was going to get his head knocked
off for her sake, she would have to give him much more
than friendship. There was no sense in fighting for
a girl who didn&#8217;t love you, or refused to surrender
herself.</p>

<p>They sat for a moment on one of the drug-store
benches.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go home now, Lou,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
get a cab and I&#8217;ll ride up with you. Your face must
be hurting you terribly. Gee, I can&#8217;t tell you how
sorry I am that all this happened, Lou. Harry&#8217;s nothing
but a low-down cur, and if he ever dares to do
anything like this again, I won&#8217;t stay home another
twenty-four hours. I&#8217;ve simply got to show them they
can&#8217;t walk all over me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about me, I&#8217;ll be all right in a couple
of days,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got something to say to
you, Blanche, but we&#8217;ll wait&#8217;ll we&#8217;re in the cab.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they rode uptown, they were silent for a while,
and then he said slowly: &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to have a show-down,
Blanche. &#8217;F I&#8217;m going to buck your whole family
and that rotten gangster brother of yours, I want
to be sure you&#8217;ll marry me, first. I&#8217;d be a fool otherwise,
you know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she answered, despondently, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t
blame you a bit. I like you lots, Lou, I&#8217;ve told you
that enough times, and you&#8217;ve helped me so much,
showing me how stupid I was, and ... I feel blue about
it. I don&#8217;t love you&mdash;you give me a sort of peaceful
feeling, and I like to hear you talk, and I don&#8217;t mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
your ways ... but that isn&#8217;t love.... Oh, I&#8217;ve tried to
love you, but it just wouldn&#8217;t come. It just wouldn&#8217;t....
I guess you&#8217;d better stop seeing me, Lou. I&#8217;d only
bring you more trouble, and it wouldn&#8217;t be fair to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see about it,&#8221; he answered, dully. &#8220;I wish I&#8217;d
never met you. You&#8217;ve never brought me anything but
sadness, after all I did for you, and there&#8217;s no use
keeping it up forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lou, don&#8217;t say that,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;You know I&#8217;ve
been honest with you. I never made any promises,
never, and I&#8217;ve always told you just how I felt. I&#8217;m
miserable about the whole thing as it is, and you can
just bet I&#8217;ll never forget you, Lou. I hung on to you
all this time because I needed you, that&#8217;s true, but I&#8217;d
never have chased you if you hadn&#8217;t wanted to be
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s over, I guess,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and talking
won&#8217;t help it any, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt a self-disparaging apathy. He had poured
out his thoughts and ideas to this girl, and set her to
thinking as she never had before, and this was his
reward, eh? The whole world was just a selfish
swamp. She had taken his gifts because they were
needed revelations to her, and now she would save
her love for some other man, who&#8217;d reverse the process
and plunder her of all she had, and feast on the
elastic dream of her body. No one ever loved you
unless you walked all over them and made them worship
your highhandedness. He had had a last lesson
now, and henceforth he would have a cheeky, appraising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
attitude toward every woman he ran across.</p>

<p>After they had traded their farewells&mdash;reluctant,
empty monosyllables, in which each person was trying
to say something more and finding himself unable&mdash;Blanche
boarded a Ninth Avenue elevated
train and rode home, with all of her thoughts and emotions
uncertain and sluggish. What was the use of living?&mdash;you
wound up by hurting the other person, or
else he injured you, with neither of you meaning to
do it, and then you separated, and accused yourself
of selfishness without being able to remedy the matter.
But this brother of hers&mdash;wait till she got hold of him!
She&#8217;d give him the worst tongue-lashing of his life,
and warn him never to interfere in her affairs again.
What did he think she was&mdash;a doormat? Brother or no
brother, he was a cruel, stupid man, and things would
have to come to an issue between them. She was
self-supporting and of age, and if her family persisted
in treating her as though she were a slave, she
would have to leave their roof.</p>

<p>As she walked into the living-room of her home,
she found her mother seated beside the table, darning
socks and munching at an apple. She threw her
hat and coat upon the seamed, leatherine couch, while
her mother asked: &#8220;How come you&#8217;re back so soon,
Blanie, dear? Ten o&#8217;clock, and <i>you</i> walkin&#8217; in! I
think the world&#8217;s comin&#8217; right to an end, I do that.
D&#8217;you have a fight with the man you was with? Tell
your ma what happened now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Harry been back?&#8221; Blanche asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he never gets back till early mornin&#8217;, and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
does Mabel, an&#8217; Phil, an&#8217; your pa. None of you ever
stays to home to keep <i>me</i> comp&#8217;ny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you get lonely, ma,&#8221; Blanche answered,
stroking her mother&#8217;s hair for a moment and trying
to feel much more concerned than she was. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
Mrs. O&#8217;Rourke, or Katie, come down to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did, sure enough, but it&#8217;s not like havin&#8217; your
own fam&#8217;ly with you,&#8221; her mother replied.</p>

<p>Blanche looked at her mother, reflectively. Poor ma,
she <i>was</i> kind of stupid, but maybe she had been more
intelligent in her younger days and had had it slowly
knocked out of her. She didn&#8217;t get much out of life,
that was a fact, and she worked hard all the time, and
she never harmed anybody. Poor ma.... Then
Blanche returned to anger at the thought of Harry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wait&#8217;ll I see Harry,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell him
a thing or two, I will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Harry been doin&#8217;, now?&#8221; her mother asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He followed me to-night till I met Lou Rosenberg,
and then he walked up and told Lou to keep away
from me, and picked a fight with him. Of course he
beat Lou up&mdash;he knows all the tricks, and Rosenberg
doesn&#8217;t. Then a cop came along, and Mister Harry
Palmer ran into a cab, like the coward he is! Believe
me, I&#8217;m going to show all of you, once and for all, that
you can&#8217;t boss me around, and if you keep it up I&#8217;ll
leave home in a jiffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I jes&#8217; know Harry&#8217;ll get into jail yet, with all this
scrappin&#8217; uh his,&#8221; her mother said, alarmedly. &#8220;Maybe
this Mister Rosinburg will have to go to the hospital,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
an&#8217; then they&#8217;ll come after Harry. Did he hurt him
awful bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he just gave him a black eye and cut his mouth,
but that was bad enough,&#8221; Blanche answered. &#8220;The
whole thing happened so quick I couldn&#8217;t do anything
about it, and besides, I never dreamt Harry would dare
to pull a stunt like that. I&#8217;m so angry I could punch
him if he was here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no way to be talkin&#8217; about your own
brother,&#8221; Mrs. Palmer said. &#8220;It&#8217;s I that don&#8217;t think
he did right, I don&#8217;t, but still, he only meant it f&#8217;r your
own good. You shouldn&#8217;t be goin&#8217; around with Jews,
you shouldn&#8217;t, and this fella Rosinburg, he&#8217;s been
makin&#8217; you act so silly-like, with all them books that
nobody c&#8217;n make head &#8217;r tail of. You&#8217;re gettin&#8217; to be
&#8217;n old girl now, Blanie, you are, and it&#8217;s time you
were thinkin&#8217; of marryin&#8217; a good man to keep you in
comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why isn&#8217;t a Jew as good as anybody else?&#8221; Blanche
asked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t love Rosenberg, but believe me, &#8217;f I
did, none of you could keep <i>me</i> away from him. I&#8217;m
going to stop seeing him &#8217;cause I don&#8217;t want him to get
into trouble all for nothing, but I won&#8217;t stand for any
more orders&mdash;I&#8217;m a free person, and I make my own
living, and &#8217;f I think I&#8217;m doing right, that&#8217;s all I care
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blanie, you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; somethin&#8217; terribul,&#8221; her
mother answered, sadly aghast. &#8220;You oughta have
more respect for your pa &#8217;n&#8217; ma, you ought. We raised
you up from a kid, an&#8217; we give you everythin&#8217; we could,
an&#8217; we only want to see you do the right thing. You&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
got to settle down and have a fine, good-looking, Christian
fellow, who&#8217;s earnin&#8217; good wages. Course, you must
be lovin&#8217; him first&mdash;I&#8217;d never want you to marry no
one you didn&#8217;t care for, I wouldn&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s not
everythin&#8217; either. I&#8217;d like to see you livin&#8217; like a lady,
I would, an&#8217; havin&#8217; a fine home, &#8217;n&#8217; servants, &#8217;n&#8217; the
best uh everythin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, marry, that&#8217;s all you ever think about,&#8221;
Blanche replied. &#8220;You mean well, ma, but you can
just see so far and no farther. What did you ever
get out of marrying, I&#8217;d like to know? Nothing but
work, and trouble, and worrying around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I want to see you do better, that&#8217;s
why,&#8221; her mother responded. &#8220;It&#8217;s I that knows how
foolish I was, I know it, and I don&#8217;t want you to go
through all the strugglin&#8217; I&#8217;ve had. &#8217;F you marry a
man like Mister Campbell, now, you&#8217;ll live in a swell
apartment an&#8217; you&#8217;ll have the things you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what I want, ma,&#8221; Blanche said,
sadly. &#8220;I want to be somebody, and find out what&#8217;s
the reason for things, and use my head for something
besides a hat-rack. Any girl can marry and let a man
use her&mdash;there&#8217;s no trick in that. I&#8217;m tired of being
just like other people&mdash;I want to act, &#8217;r write, &#8217;r paint,
and make a name for myself. You think a woman
shouldn&#8217;t do anything except have children and be as
comfortable as she can. You can&#8217;t understand what
I&#8217;m looking for, ma.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s I that can&#8217;t, it&#8217;s all foolishness to me,&#8221; her
mother replied, perplexedly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why a woman
should be anythin&#8217; &#8217;cept a good wife &#8217;n&#8217; a good mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
&#8217;f she finds a man that&#8217;ll treat her right &#8217;n&#8217; provide f&#8217;r
her. This bein&#8217; somebody you&#8217;re always talkin&#8217; about,
I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;ll ever make you happy, I don&#8217;t.
It&#8217;s your heart that counts most, an&#8217; nothin&#8217; else. You
never talked like this &#8217;fore you met that Rosinburg.
I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re not goin&#8217; to meet him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re both just wasting our words&mdash;let&#8217;s cut it
out,&#8221; Blanche said, depressedly, as she walked into
her room.</p>

<p>Her mother looked after her with a sorrowful, uncomprehending
expression. What was her poor daughter
coming to, with all this unlady-like nonsense, and
all this refusing to listen to the counsel of her family,
who only wanted her to have a happy and respected
future. Well, maybe she&#8217;d change, now that she
wasn&#8217;t seeing that Jew-fellow any more. Jews were
human beings, but they were tricky and queer and
always out after the money, and they had no right to
be picking on Gentile girls.... Of course, if Blanche
didn&#8217;t change, then her pa and Harry would have to
take hold of her. She mustn&#8217;t be allowed to go to the
dogs and ruin herself and her chances. While she,
the mother, would never let the menfolks abuse her
daughter or lay their hands on her, she still felt that
they would have to act sternly to bring Blanche to her
senses. It couldn&#8217;t be helped as long as Blanche refused
to behave.</p>

<p>When Blanche rose on the following morning, Harry
was still asleep, and they did not collide until she returned
from work that night. The family were seated
around the supper-table, and Mabel looked at Blanche,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
with curiosity and reproach interwoven, while her
father squinted questioningly at her, and Philip
squirmed in his chair, like some one waiting for a
dynamite detonation. He hated family quarrels&mdash;you
couldn&#8217;t agree with both sides and yet you were always
expected to. He felt that the others were &#8220;too
hard&#8221; on Blanche, and he hoped that she would give
them a piece of her mind.</p>

<p>Harry had a nonchalant mien which placated the
fear within him which he did not quite admit to himself&mdash;there
was something about Blanche that he
couldn&#8217;t fathom, and no matter how much he sought
to squelch this alien foe, with word and action, it
never died&mdash;a derided but still-threatening specter.</p>

<p>Blanche was silent until she had seated herself at
the table, and then she burst forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry, I&#8217;m going to tell you something&mdash;&#8217;f you ever
beat up any one I&#8217;m with again, and try to order me
around, I&#8217;ll break something over your head! Just
try it once more and see what happens!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that little thing,&#8221; Harry answered. &#8220;The
last person I was afraid of, he died ten years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just how I feel,&#8221; Blanche replied. &#8220;&#8217;F I&#8217;m
not left alone from now on, I&#8217;m going on the war-path.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bla-anie, you mustn&#8217;t talk that way, an&#8217; you, too,
Harry,&#8221; Mrs. Palmer said. &#8220;I never, never heard of
a brother an&#8217; sister carryin&#8217; on like this! I do think
Blanche oughta listen more to what we tell her, I do,
but breakin&#8217; things over y&#8217;r heads, why I never heard
the like of it. You won&#8217;t help things that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Blanche, we&#8217;ve got to lay down the law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
to you,&#8221; her father said. &#8220;No more goin&#8217; around with
Jews, and no more talkin&#8217; back all the time. I&#8217;m your
father an&#8217; I&#8217;m gonna put my foot down. You&#8217;re not a
bad kid, I don&#8217;t say that, but you&#8217;re too fresh, an&#8217; you
think you know it all. You better stop readin&#8217; them
phony books and pay attention to yourself, an&#8217; act
like a reg&#8217;lar girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I leave home, what&#8217;ll you do about it?&#8221;
Blanche asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stop you from doin&#8217; that, but &#8217;f you do,
don&#8217;t think you can come back here again&mdash;not &#8217;less
you&#8217;re married, anyway,&#8221; her father replied. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all
be through with you then, an&#8217; you&#8217;ll be no daughter uh
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gotten into you, Blanche,&#8221;
Mabel said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to have any sense nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t,&#8221; answered Blanche. &#8220;All you
care about is having a good time, and working men
for all they&#8217;re worth, and hunting around for a fellow
with money who&#8217;ll marry you. I want to do something
that counts, and I want to look into things. That&#8217;s
all a mystery to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so-o?&#8221; Mabel asked, bridling up. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
just as good a head as you have, even &#8217;f I don&#8217;t go
around with a chip on my shoulder, like you do, and
tell people I&#8217;m better than they are. I&#8217;m gonna be a
rich lady and be up in the world &#8217;fore I&#8217;m through with
the game, but you&#8217;ll wind up with nothing but that
hot air you&#8217;re always spouting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think you&#8217;re all too rough on Blanche,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Philip said. &#8220;Maybe she ought to marry and settle
down, but it&#8217;s her look-out. &#8217;F she wants to make a
name for herself, and study something, I don&#8217;t see anything
so awful about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the best one in this fam&#8217;ly, Phil,&#8221; said
Blanche, with a grateful look. &#8220;You&#8217;re not so wise,
but you do believe in letting people alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you an&#8217; him are twins, all right,&#8221; Harry interposed,
&#8220;but he knows enough to keep quiet most
of the time, and you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Harry, what did I ever do against you?&#8221;
Philip asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing, but you wouldn&#8217;t side with Blanche
all the time &#8217;f you wasn&#8217;t like she is,&#8221; Harry answered.</p>

<p>The argument went on, with Blanche subsiding to a
hopeless silence, but as the meal ended, it became more
indifferent. Their appeased appetites brought the
others a brief, sluggish contentment, and they felt sure
that it was all just a &#8220;lot of jawing,&#8221; and that Blanche
would never really revolt&mdash;she was a Palmer, after all.</p>

<p>The next week passed quietly enough, with Blanche
and Harry casting disdainful looks at each other but
rarely speaking, and the rest of the family persuaded
that it might be better to leave Blanche alone as long
as she failed to do anything definitely objectionable.
Then, one evening, just after Blanche had returned
from work, a loud rapping sounded on the front door,
and after her mother had responded, Blanche heard
a gruff voice asking: &#8220;Is this where Mabel Palmer
lives, huh?&#8221; When her mother had answered yes, the
gruff voice continued: &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re detectives from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the Sixth Precinct, and we want to have a talk with
you people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord, what&#8217;s the matter&mdash;what&#8217;s happened to
Mabel?&#8221; Mrs. Palmer asked, agitatedly, as she entered
the living-room, with the two detectives walking
behind her.</p>

<p>They were tall, burly men, in dark, ill-fitting suits,
slouch hats of brown, and heavy, black shoes, and one
of them had a florid, impassive face, while the other
was tanned and more openly inquiring. They sat down
in chairs and looked the Palmers over. Harry and his
father sought to appear calm and careless but could
not repress an involuntary nervousness&mdash;there were
several shady spots in their lives that shrank from the
impending searchlight, but these bulls wouldn&#8217;t be
acting this way if they really <i>knew</i> anything&mdash;while
Philip looked warmly innocent&mdash;they didn&#8217;t have anything
on <i>him</i>&mdash;and Mrs. Palmer wrung her hands and
told herself that all of her dire prophecies had been
fulfilled. Blanche was curious but undisturbed&mdash;little
Mabel Know-Everything had gotten into trouble at
last, but what was it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Your girl&#8217;s locked up at Arlington Market,&#8221; the
florid detective said. &#8220;You know why, don&#8217;tcha?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor little Mabel, what&#8217;s happened to her?&#8221;
Mrs. Palmer asked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know a thing that she&#8217;s
done, I swear I don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s straight, we don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s all about,&#8221;
Harry said, and his father eagerly corroborated him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we nabbed her this afternoon on Broadway,&#8221;
the other detective replied. &#8220;She&#8217;s been mixing up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
with a lotta bond-thieves, and we think she&#8217;s one of
their go-betweens. She&#8217;s been seen all the time with
the brains uh the gang, hanging around cabarets with
him. We got him yesterday, and we&#8217;ll scoop in the
rest of them before to-morrow. If you people don&#8217;t
know anything about this, it&#8217;s mighty funny you let
your daughter associate with a gang like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, why do you let her run loose all the time?&#8221;
the florid detective asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always told her not to be so wild, I&#8217;ve always,&#8221;
answered Mrs. Palmer, &#8220;but she never listened
to me. She&#8217;s really a good girl off&#8217;cer, she didn&#8217;t mean
any harm, but she likes to have men payin&#8217; attentions
to her. I know she hasn&#8217;t done anything wrong, I
know it. She prob&#8217;bly thought those men was honest,
that&#8217;s it, an&#8217; she b&#8217;lieved all the lies they told her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what they all say,&#8221; the other detective replied,
gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong, Mabe&#8217;s a straight kid,&#8221; Mr. Palmer
said. &#8220;She got into bum comp&#8217;ny an&#8217; didn&#8217;t know it,
that must be it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what <i>you</i> say, but we got a diff&#8217;rent idea,&#8221;
the florid detective retorted. &#8220;Sure, you&#8217;d take up for
her, that&#8217;s an old trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cert&#8217;nly will,&#8221; the father answered, spiritedly.
&#8220;&#8217;F you&#8217;ve got any evidence against her, all right, but
I&#8217;ll have to hear it first &#8217;fore I b&#8217;lieve it. I&#8217;ll take up
for my own daughter any time, any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I understand,&#8221; the other detective said, more
amiably. &#8220;All we know&#8217;s that she went around with
that gang, hitting up the night clubs, but we haven&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
connected her with anything yet. It looks bad for her,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll put her through a grilling to-night and find
out more about it&#8221;&mdash;the florid detective suddenly
turned to Blanche. &#8220;What d&#8217;you do for a living?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I work at Madame Jaurette&#8217;s Beauty Parlor, on
Fifth Avenue near Twenty-sixth,&#8221; Blanche responded,
coolly. &#8220;Come down there some day and I&#8217;ll curl your
blond locks for you. They need it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective grinned and replied: &#8220;We&#8217;ll look you
up, don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, what&#8217;s your trade?&#8221; he asked her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t do much now &#8217;cause my leg&#8217;s on the bum,&#8221;
Mr. Palmer replied. &#8220;I used to be a bartender in the
old days when we had a little freedom in this town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d better stop loafing around and get a
job,&#8221; the detective advised.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always work when I&#8217;m able to,&#8221; said Mr. Palmer.
&#8220;I used to manage my boy here, Harry, Battling
Murphy&mdash;maybe you&#8217;ve seen him scrap somewheres.
He got a raw deal an&#8217; they barred him from the ring,
but he&#8217;ll be back there &#8217;fore long, don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The florid detective looked closely at Harry and
then said: &#8220;Damned if it isn&#8217;t Bat&#8217; Murphy himself!
I won some dough on you once when you was fighting
Kid Morley down at the Terrace. Why didn&#8217;t you
tell us who you was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You was askin&#8217; my folks questions an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t
wanna butt in,&#8221; Harry replied as he shook hands,
warmly, with the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear you been cutting up with a bad gang lately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Bat&#8217;,&#8221; the other detective interposed, in a tone of
friendly reproof. &#8220;Better cut it out and get back into
condition again. We wouldn&#8217;t like to pull you
in, y&#8217;know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You c&#8217;n lay a bet I will,&#8221; Harry replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m no
has-been yet, I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you I knocked a coupla fellas
out at the gym the other day.... An&#8217; now about this
poor kid sister uh mine. She isn&#8217;t a bad one, but you
know how fellas c&#8217;n fill a girl up with a lotta phony
gab. I don&#8217;t think she knew a damn thing about what
was goin&#8217; on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can bail her out, all right, when we&#8217;re through
putting the question to her,&#8221; the other detective said.
&#8220;Know any one to go to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know any one, I&#8217;ll say we do,&#8221; Harry answered.
&#8220;Why, Bill O&#8217;Brien, the Wigwam chief in this district&#8217;s
a good friend uh the old man, an&#8217; me too. He&#8217;ll
put up the coin in a second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, come down to Arlington Market court
to-morrow morning, ten sharp, when she&#8217;s arraigned,
and we&#8217;ll see what we can do,&#8221; the detective said, with
respect in his voice, as both of them rose. &#8220;And by
the way, who&#8217;s this man in the corner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s my brother Phil, works in a drug store a
coupla blocks away,&#8221; Harry answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A-all right, I guess you&#8217;re all straight enough,&#8221; the
detective replied, genially. &#8220;Only, if your kid sister
gets out of this, you better keep a strict tab on her.
She&#8217;s a flighty one and no mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sure I am that this&#8217;ll teach poor Mabel a lesson,&#8221;
Mrs. Palmer said, with a sad eagerness. &#8220;An&#8217; to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
think she&#8217;s sittin&#8217; in a cell right now. It&#8217;s terribul, it
is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We-ell, don&#8217;t take it to heart, she may be out soon,&#8221;
the other detective answered.</p>

<p>The detectives departed, and after Harry had cautiously
opened the door and assured himself that they
had gone, he came back and said: &#8220;We&#8217;ve gotta get
poor Mabe outa this. I&#8217;m gonna run over to Tenth
Avenue now an see &#8217;f I c&#8217;n get ahold of O&#8217;Brien.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder whether they&#8217;ve got the goods on her,&#8221;
his father said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think a wise girl like Mabel
would lay herself open to five years in the pen. It
don&#8217;t seem reas&#8217;nable. She musta had the wool pulled
over her eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to happen to any girl,&#8221; Harry answered.
&#8220;When a girl goes out with a guy, how&#8217;s she to know
whether he&#8217;s a crook &#8217;r not? Besides, if Mabel was
in on it she&#8217;d have been flashin&#8217; a roll around here,
and if she&#8217;s got one she&#8217;s sure been hidin&#8217; it well, I&#8217;ll
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do think she oughta be more careful &#8217;bout
who she goes with,&#8221; Mrs. Palmer said. &#8220;I swear, between
Mabel and Blanche, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; right to my grave,
I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, don&#8217;t take on so, Kate,&#8221; her husband answered.
&#8220;Mabel&#8217;s not like Blanche anyway&mdash;she don&#8217;t put on
the dog an&#8217; tell her folks they don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217;.
She jus&#8217; wants to have a good time an&#8217; land a good
man f&#8217;r herself, and she&#8217;ll get over this mess all right.
She made a mistake in the crowd she went with&mdash;they
prob&#8217;bly told her they was rich business men.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll have to get arrested before any of
you&#8217;ll think I know something,&#8221; Blanche broke in,
disgustedly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry Mabel got into this fix, but
if you try to play men for their money, you&#8217;ve got to
expect that they&#8217;ll turn the tables on you, the first
chance they get.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan, you&#8217;re jes&#8217; jealous uh her,&#8221; Harry said.
&#8220;You&#8217;d do the same thing &#8217;f you had nerve enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now, this is no time f&#8217;r scrappin&#8217;,&#8221; his father
interposed. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to hustle around to O&#8217;Brien
an&#8217; see what he c&#8217;n do f&#8217;r us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two Palmers departed, and Blanche and Philip
tried to soothe the mother, who had begun to weep and
rock in her chair. Blanche felt a dab of malice toward
her sister&mdash;Mabel was so dreamless, and never tried
to understand Blanche&#8217;s hopes and desires, and was
always scoffing and sneering&mdash;but it was swallowed
up by a sense of enforced compassion. Perhaps Mabel
was just a misguided girl whose head had been turned
by the flatteries of men, and perhaps she would wake
up now and begin to think, and question herself and
her life, to a small degree at any rate. In addition,
Blanche was relieved at this turn in events, since it
might distract the attention of her family and make
them drop for a time their insistence upon marriage,
and their naggings about Campbell, and their jeers
at the books that she read. She went to bed early that
night, and reclined awake for a long time, spinning
her hopes from the dark texture of the room. After all,
why did she waste so much time in arguing with her
family? They would never understand her in a million<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
years, and they meant well in spite of all of their
meanness, but she had simply passed beyond them.
They wanted her to be like them, and share their
ideas of happiness and propriety, and they used cruel
methods and threats without knowing how cruel they
were because they felt that the end could apologize
for the means. It was all inevitable, and the best thing
that she could do would be quietly to pack her belongings
some day and move out to some rooming-house
uptown before they knew what was happening. Then
let them rave all they wanted&mdash;what could they do?</p>

<p>Besides, her leaving would convince them that she
&#8220;meant business,&#8221; and most of their bullying was probably
due to the fact that they still thought that they
could force her to obey them. When she was finally
living in a place of her own, she&#8217;d go to some art or
dramatic school at night&mdash;maybe she could learn to
draw after all, since she had been very clever with
sketches when she was a child at school, and still
poked around with a pencil now and then. Or again,
why couldn&#8217;t she be able to act on the stage, if she
were only taught how to handle her voice and her
limbs. These famous actresses, they hadn&#8217;t been perfect
and accomplished in their cradles, and if she
studied English and learned how to speak more correctly,
she might have as good a chance as they had
had. Nothing ever came to you unless you had a desperate
faith in yourself. She would have to work long
and hard at these things, she knew that, but she
worked hard every day as it was, without deriving any
satisfaction from it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>An image of Rosenberg slipped back to her. Poor
boy, wonder what he was doing now? She owed a
great deal to him, and the only payment that she had
given had been to jilt him. Was it always as one-sided
as this between men and women&mdash;always a kind of
slave-and-master affair, with one person taking everything
and the other person hanging on because he
couldn&#8217;t think of any one else and was grateful for
the scraps that were thrown to him? She hadn&#8217;t meant
to hurt this boy&mdash;he had wanted feelings that were
impossible to her, and her body had often endured his
hands out of pity, and her only reason for guilt was
that she had kept on seeing him. But she had needed,
oh, she had needed all of the spurrings-on, and answers,
and thoughts, and beliefs in her, which he had poured
out&mdash;yes, it had been selfishness on her part, but she
was beginning to think that people could never avoid
being selfish to each other in some respect, even though
they hid it behind all kinds of other names and assertions.
They <i>could</i> make it aboveboard, though, by
confessing the unevenness of their relations, and by
not demanding anything that each person was not compelled
to give of his own accord. The ideal, of course,
would be a man and a woman who selfishly craved all
of each other, for deeply permanent reasons, in which
case each one would become a happy plunderer&mdash;did
such a thing ever quite come off?... Her thoughts
trailed out into sleep.</p>

<p>On the next morning at the Beauty Parlor, Blanche
was distracted, and a little uneasy about her sister&mdash;after
all, the poor kid was just conceited and flighty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
with no real harm in her&mdash;and when Philip came in
at noon and told her that Mabel had been released,
for lack of evidence, Blanche was glad that the matter
had blown over. When Blanche returned from her
work that night, Mabel was seated in the one armchair
in the apartment, with the rest of the family
grouped admiringly around her. Now that it was all
over, they regarded her as something of a heroine&mdash;one
who had tussled with their never-recognized but
potent enemy, the law, and emerged scot-free&mdash;and
although they qualified this attitude with warnings
and chidings, it dominated them, nevertheless. The
mother remained an exception&mdash;she hoped that her
daughter would act more soberly now, and leave her
nightly dissipations, and mingle with more honest men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re out,&#8221; Blanche said, after kissing
her sister. &#8220;Did they treat you rough after they
arrested you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They wasn&#8217;t so bad,&#8221; Mabel answered. &#8220;They put
me through a coupla third degrees, first when they
brought me in, and then another one &#8217;bout nine in
the ev&#8217;ning, tryin&#8217; to trip me up, y&#8217;know. They said
they knew I was a prostitute, jes&#8217; to get my goat, and
I started to cry and said it was a darn lie&mdash;I jes&#8217;
couldn&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They pull that off on ev&#8217;ry girl,&#8221; Harry said. &#8220;&#8217;F
she is one, then she&#8217;ll own up cause she thinks they
know all about it&mdash;that&#8217;s the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you happen to get in with a crowd like
that?&#8221; Blanche asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what they was,&#8221; Mabel replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
aggrievedly. &#8220;Gee whiz, you can&#8217;t follow a fella around
an&#8217; see what he&#8217;s doin&#8217;, can you? This Bob Sullivan,
now, he told me he was a book-maker at the races,
an ev&#8217;rybody I knew seemed to think he was. Then
he had a friend, Jack Misner, said he was a jockey&mdash;a
little runt of a guy. Bob swore all the time he was
gone on me. He&#8217;s a nice fella at that, he is, an&#8217; I&#8217;m
darn sorry they got him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you shouldn&#8217;t be,&#8221; her mother said. &#8220;When
any one&#8217;s dishonest they oughta get punished for it,
they ought. This world would be a fine world, it
would, &#8217;f ev&#8217;rybody went round and robbed ev&#8217;rybody
else. An&#8217; what&#8217;s more, I do hope you&#8217;ll stay home
more now, Mabel dear, an&#8217; keep outa trouble, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, pipe down, Kate,&#8221; her husband broke in.
&#8220;She&#8217;s gotta size up her men better fr&#8217;m now on, sure,
but you can&#8217;t expect her to sit around here all night.
She c&#8217;n have all the fun she wants, I don&#8217;t mind, long
as she looks them over more careful an&#8217; don&#8217;t swallow
all their gab.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s jes&#8217; no use f&#8217;r me to say anythin&#8217;,&#8221; Mrs. Palmer
answered, dolefully. &#8220;None uh you ever pays any attention
to Kate Palmer till it&#8217;s too late, and then it&#8217;s
ma do this f&#8217;r me, an&#8217; ma do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll watch out more, ma, I will,&#8221; Mabel said.
&#8220;When I meet a fella with a big wad I&#8217;m gonna find
out how he makes it &#8217;fore I let him take me out. A
girl&#8217;s gotta protect herself, that&#8217;s a fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t hurt you to go out with a few men that
work for a living&mdash;just for a change,&#8221; Philip said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
&#8220;Maybe they won&#8217;t take you to swell joints, maybe
not, but they&#8217;ll get you into less trouble all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wish any uh Blanche&#8217;s kind on me,&#8221; Mabel
retorted. &#8220;When I want to go to a sixty-cent movie-house,
&#8217;r sit down on a bench in the park, I&#8217;ll have my
head tested to see &#8217;f I&#8217;m all there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her little, straight nose turned up, and her loosely
small lips drew together to a tight complacency. Her
plump face was more drawn, and hollows were under
her eyes, and a trace of fright still lingered in the
black eyes, but the expression on her face was one
of rebuked but still ruling impudence. She told herself
that she had been stung once by men&mdash;an incredible
incident&mdash;and would henceforth set out to
revenge herself upon them. It was all just a fight to
see which side would get the best of the other, and she
wouldn&#8217;t be caught napping twice. Her goal was to
marry a man with money and good looks, and she
wouldn&#8217;t allow anything to deter her. Beneath these
determinations, sentimentalities and fears, aroused by
the shock of her arrest, told her that she was flirting
too closely with danger, and that it might be better to
look for a stalwart youth with a laughable &#8220;line&#8221; and
a movie-hero face&mdash;she was tired, after all, of letting
homely, slow-tongued fellows kiss and hug her because
they spent money to give her the gay nights that were
due to every girl, and then again, she really ought
to consider her poor ma, who was always fretting about
her. Aw, well, she <i>would</i> slow down just a little and stay
home once in a while, and select her escorts with more
of an eye to their safety and their physical attraction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
and with money alone no longer all-supreme, but she
would never subside to a back-number&mdash;not she.
Plenty of girls ended by catching rich young men with
a dash to them, and she could do the same thing if
she kept a level head.</p>

<p>As Blanche listened to her sister, a disapproving
sadness welled up within her&mdash;same old Mabel, not
a hairbreadth changed. People seemed to be born
in one way and to stick to it for the rest of their lives.
She herself had never been quite like Mabel, even when
she, Blanche, had been much more stupid than she
might be now. She had always hunted for something
without knowing what it was, and had always been
&#8220;easier,&#8221; and more unhappy, and more concerned with
the &#8220;inside&#8221; of herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men and men, that&#8217;s all you&#8217;ve got on your mind,&#8221;
she said to her sister, softly. &#8220;&#8217;F you were ever
wrecked now on some island, like I read about once,
with nothing but another girl to keep you company, I
think you&#8217;d go mad. You wouldn&#8217;t know what to do
with yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know who would,&#8221; Mabel answered.
&#8220;Why, even you, smarty, you&#8217;ve got to step out with
diff&#8217;rent fellas, I notice. I suppose I&#8217;ll have to excuse
myself f&#8217;r being a woman, next thing I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your only excuse,&#8221; Blanche said, as she
turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a good enough one to suit me,&#8221; Mabel
retorted, irascibly.</p>

<p>Blanche walked into her room without replying.
What was the use of speaking to people when your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
words went into one of their ears and instantly flew
out of the other? Her future course of action had
been determined. If her family ceased to bother her,
she would continue to live with them, and go to some
school at least five nights out of each week and reserve
the other two for sessions with men and for
relaxation. She wouldn&#8217;t live like a nun, that was
ridiculous, but she would make a serious effort to
master some profession or form of expression that
would be much higher and more inwardly satisfying
than doing the same thing with her hands every day.
And if her family continued to be meddlesome and
dictating, she would move out some morning when
the menfolk were away.</p>

<p>During the next two days her existence was undisturbed.
The Palmers had been somewhat chastened
by Mabel&#8217;s arrest, and they had to admit that, in spite
of the disagreeable mystery that Blanche had become,
she <i>did</i> manage to keep herself out of difficulties.
Their confidence in Mabel was not as great as it had
been, and it affected to a moderate degree their temporary
reactions toward Blanche.</p>

<p>On the third afternoon, Campbell telephoned Blanche
at the Beauty Parlor and arranged to meet her that
night. She wanted to tell him that he would have to
remain content with her friendship and that otherwise
she could not see him again, and that her promise to
&#8220;think over&#8221; his offer of an apartment and a shrouded
alliance had been caused merely by her desperation
in the face of barriers that withheld her from her
desires. She intended to tell him frankly that she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
resolved to permit him no greater physical liberties
than a kiss now and then, and that she had made up
her mind to reserve herself for the advent of an actual
love. If he still wanted to take her out under those
conditions, she&#8217;d be willing to see him once a week at
most&mdash;he <i>was</i> a jolly sedative in his way&mdash;but he
would have to show her that he had a serious mind
and a sincere love for her before she would reconsider
his pleas. After all, there was such a thing as slowly
falling in love with a man, if he made you entirely
reverse your previous image of him. Campbell would
never closely approach her ideals, she knew that, but
perhaps he might make a respectable progress toward
it, in which case she might accept him as the best
real prospect possible to her.</p>

<p>She dressed to meet him that night, with a division
of cautious and sanguinely impertinent feelings seething
within her. As they were walking down Ninth
Avenue, he looked admiringly at her round white felt
hat, trimmed with a zigzag dash of black velvet, and
her plain yellow pongee dress that had an air of subdued
sprightliness about it, and her long, black coat
with squirrel fur at the bottom. These girls, working
for twenty-five a week, or thirty at most, how on earth
did they manage to doll up like Peggy Hopkins Joyce?
Funny too, they never seemed to retain this penny-transforming
ability after they were married!</p>

<p>&#8220;You look like a million bucks, to-night,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I&#8217;d give a week&#8217;s salary to know how you do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, listen to Mister Innocent&mdash;never heard about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
instalment plans, and bargain hunting, and getting
things cheap &#8217;cause you know the head buyer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, even at that it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s eighth wonder to
me,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid to take you any place to-night.
Everybody I know&#8217;ll be trying to horn in on
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought competition was your middle
name,&#8221; she said, brightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s only an alias&mdash;too much of it&#8217;s as bad as
too little,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Anyway, don&#8217;t you get tired
of scrimping and putting yourself out for clothes all
the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What &#8217;f I do?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know what I told you time before last,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll pay all the bills and like it, any time
you&#8217;re ready. You said you were going to think it
over&mdash;remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; she replied, soberly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to you
about it later on to-night. And don&#8217;t call a cab, Joe.
Let&#8217;s walk a few blocks, for a change. You always act
like you hated to use your legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I use &#8217;em enough behind the lights to make up for
all the riding I do,&#8221; he answered, amused.</p>

<p>They strolled over to Broadway, and were silent
most of the time, save for commenting on some of the
people striding past them. When they reached the
corner of Broadway and one of the Forties, he said:
&#8220;Say, Blanche, a friend of mine, Jack Donovan, &#8217;s pulling
a party to-night in his place. There&#8217;ll be two &#8217;r
three chorines from the Passing Gaieties show, and a
couple of respectable crooks&mdash;um, I mean bootleggers&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
kind of thing. I said I&#8217;d be up about
eleven-thirty but I won&#8217;t go if you don&#8217;t want to. We
could drop in at The Golden Mill and kill time until
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I&#8217;ll come, &#8217;f it&#8217;s not going to be too wild,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;I never was much on those parties where
they try to pass you around like you was a dish of ice
cream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strictly pairs at Jack&#8217;s place, and the same pair
lasts through the night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Stick to the woman
you&#8217;re with &#8217;r take the elevator down&mdash;that&#8217;s the
rule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;F there&#8217;s too much booze flowing, that elevator-boy
sure must be kept busy,&#8221; she retorted, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we run it ourselves&mdash;we&#8217;re accommodating,&#8221;
he said, with a grin.</p>

<p>After they were seated at a table in The Golden
Mill and had finished half of their highballs, she said:
&#8220;Joe, I&#8217;m going to talk serious to you. I was just in
a silly mood when I said last time I&#8217;d think about living
with you. It wouldn&#8217;t work out&mdash;it never does unless
two people really love each other. &#8217;F I ever fall
hard in love with you, Joe, I&#8217;ll do it in a minute. I&#8217;m
not afraid, but I don&#8217;t love you now. Besides, it&#8217;s not
just a question of some man, with me. I&#8217;ve made up
my mind to try and be an artist or an actress&mdash;don&#8217;t
laugh now&mdash;and I wonder whether you could help me
any.&#8221;</p>

<p>He listened to her with chagrin and amusement&mdash;going
after her was like wading for eels, and she certainly
had this &#8220;higher aspiration&#8221; bug with a vengeance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
These girls now, they were amenable enough
when their only desires were a good time, fine clothes,
and a man who wouldn&#8217;t give them the shivers, but the
moment they started to get this &#8220;self-expression,&#8221;
I-want-to-be-different craze, boy, what a tough proposition
they became. Still, even that could be turned to
your advantage if you &#8220;yessed&#8221; it along and insinuated
that you alone could cause it to succeed. In addition,
in spite of his cynical feelings, he could not quite down
his respect for her determination to struggle out of her
present life. She was no ordinary girl, that was certain,
and in a way she was a marvel, in view of the
family that she came from and the half-dirty, low-down
flat in which she&#8217;d been raised. She probably had
no acting ability&mdash;they hardly ever did&mdash;but you could
never be sure about <i>her</i>; she was little Miss Surprise
herself. Well, if he could only land her first, he&#8217;d be
willing to help her along&mdash;why not?</p>

<p>He looked at her eager face, that was not quite
pretty but boldly attractive and well-spaced, and the
almost full drop of her bosom rising and falling more
quickly as she talked, and the restrained sturdiness of
her lips. Beyond a doubt, he&#8217;d give his right hand to
have her, and yet he couldn&#8217;t absolutely tell himself
why.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, Blanchie&#8217;s gone and got stage-struck,&#8221;
he answered, lightly. &#8220;You know I&#8217;ll do anything for
you, you know that, but I don&#8217;t want to see you wasting
your time. This acting game&#8217;s a long, hard proposition&mdash;some
get in overnight but they&#8217;re damn few in
number. I know girls who&#8217;ve been in it for years, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
all they&#8217;ve got is a diamond ring in pawn and a favorite
chair at the booking agencies. A girl&#8217;s got to have more
than ambition to make any one notice her on Broadway,
nowadays. How d&#8217;you know you&#8217;re fit to be an
actorine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, but I want a try-out just the same,&#8221; she
replied. &#8220;How&#8217;ll I ever know what I&#8217;m cut out for
unless I go to it and see what I can do? &#8217;F I turn
out to be a frost as &#8217;n actress, I&#8217;ll take up drawing &#8217;r
something else. There must be something I can do as
good as other people, besides working like a nigger
every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure there must,&#8221; he said, soothingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m with
you all the time&mdash;I like to see a girl who can think of
something else besides putting on the glad rags and
lifting the glasses. You&#8217;ve got the stuff in you, and
it&#8217;s never had a chance to come out, and I&#8217;m the one
man you know who can help you in the acting line,
don&#8217;t forget that. I&#8217;ll get you a try-out for some play&mdash;just
a little part, y&#8217;know, where you walk across the
stage &#8217;n&#8217; say &#8216;Madame, will you have the tea served
now, or next Monday?&#8217; I&#8217;ll make them take you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221; she asked, eagerly. &#8220;Say, you&#8217;re a
brick, Joe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not my head, anyways,&#8221; he said, smiling. &#8220;D&#8217;you
know, I&#8217;m really gone about you. It took two years
to turn the trick&mdash;little Joe hates to be caught, he
does&mdash;but &#8217;f I&#8217;m not in love with you now, it&#8217;s so close,
I can feel the breath on my neck. Why don&#8217;t you
hook up with me and let me have you meet the right
people and push you along? You&#8217;re not in love with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
me now, but you like me pretty well at that, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but I want to find out first
whether you really mean all of this, and whether you&#8217;re
really int&#8217;rested in the same things I am. You mustn&#8217;t
be angry at this. It&#8217;s a serious thing to me, and I want
to be sure. Besides, &#8217;f you do care for me, why can&#8217;t
you help me even &#8217;f we <i>are</i> just friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I will,&#8221; he responded, with an easy
heartiness. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like a business transaction to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>If she became more and more dependent upon his
assistance, she couldn&#8217;t hold out forever.... They
departed from the cabaret, after another highball,
and went to the apartment of his friend, Jack Donovan.
Donovan was a sturdy man of forty, whose five-feet-eleven
were supported by flat feet and buttressed
by the girth of a paunch. His head was one-quarter
bald and his black hair was wetly combed down, and
the oval of his face, rising from an almost double
chin, was a morbid calculation, as though he were
weary of his stage-laughs and smiles, and wondering
what in the devil was so funny about life, anyway, except
that people liked to pay money to be joshed into
believing that it was. He did a monologue in vaudeville&mdash;one
of those acts in which a portly &#8220;Senator
Callahan,&#8221; in a frock coat and a high hat, cracks jokes
about the events and foibles and personages of the
day, with many a crudely ironical fling at grafting
officials and high prices and prohibition, with lower
puns and slapstick harangues against the prevailing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
immodesty of feminine attire&mdash;&#8220;They&#8217;d wear &#8217;em two
feet above the knees if they weren&#8217;t afraid it would
completely discourage a guy.&#8221; He greeted Joe with an
off-hand amiability, and looked at Blanche, after the
introduction, with a side-long intentness. Joe knew
how to pick &#8217;em, all right&mdash;she wasn&#8217;t a doll-baby but
she had class to her.</p>

<p>The two front parlors of the apartment had an ebony
baby-grand piano, and Louis Sixteenth furniture picked
up at auctions and standing beside the squat, varnished
products of Grand Rapids&mdash;an oak sideboard with
large, glass knobs and an oak settee. Some bottles and
other accessories were on the sideboard, and Donovan
returned to his interrupted task of making a round of
cocktails. The other guests had already arrived&mdash;the
two chorus girls mentioned by Campbell, and another
woman whose occupation might not have desired a
public announcement, and two business men who
dabbled in liquor-selling on the side.</p>

<p>One of the chorus girls, Flo Kennedy, looked like
the wax clothes dummy that can be observed in shop-windows,
and hardly showed much more animation,
except that when she spoke, the figure became slightly
more crude and less aloof. Her round face was inhumanly
symmetrical below her dark-brown hair, and
its expression was, well, a no-trespassing sign, over
the composed expectation of masculine advances. She
wore a short-skirted thing of terra-cotta silk and cream
lace, and flesh-colored stockings rolled just below the
knees, and black pumps. Her companion, Grace Henderson,
was a short, slender, Jewish girl in a jauntily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
plain black gown, with bobbed, blondined hair and
a mincing, sensuous glisten on her face&mdash;pretty in
spite of the tell-tale curve at the end of her nose. The
third woman, Madge Gowan, was silent and dark, with
a half-ugly, long face, whose shapely cheeks and chin
partly diminished the opposite effect, and a fully
curved, strong body.</p>

<p>One of the business men, Sol Kossler, a Jew in his
early forties, was roly-poly and half bald, with a
jowled, broad-nosed face on which smug and sentimental
confidences were twined&mdash;one of those merchants
who succeed more through luck than because
of hard shrewdness&mdash;while the other, Al Simmonds,
was robust but not stout and had a shock of wavy
black hair, and the depressed face of a man who knew
that he was hoodwinking himself, in his life and
thoughts, but could not spy any other recourse. In
their neatly pressed and creased gray suits, both of
the men looked as though their objective were the immaculate
erasure of individuality.</p>

<p>The conversation reverberated with continual laughter.
The men expected each other to utter wise-cracks,
and digs at each other&#8217;s weaknesses, and humorous
tales, and each one was constantly egging the other
on to self-surpassing retorts. The women were not
expected to do much except listen, and laugh or smile
at the right places, and join in the intervals of more
placid gossip about theatrical people, and indicate a
sexual responsiveness without becoming demonstrative
(sex would have been boresome to all of them without
the assumption of gayly parrying uncertainties, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
though they knew in advance what the night&#8217;s outcome
would be, pro or con).</p>

<p>To Blanche, they were an emptily hilarious lot, out
for the usual things that men and women wanted from
each other, and merely laughing and idling on the way
to them&mdash;not at all interested in the big, serious things
of which she had had a revealing glimpse&mdash;but they
<i>were</i> funny at times, and it <i>was</i> pleasant to be a young
woman patently desired by men, and the chance to be
amused and self-forgetful for one night was not to be
sneezed at. She joined in the repartee between Kossler
and Donovan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear you sold some shirts to Mayor Kelly the
other day,&#8221; Donovan said. &#8220;One more vote shot to
hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I voted for him last time when he bought them from
Sax and Mulberry,&#8221; Kossler retorted. &#8220;Li&#8217;l&#8217; Sol can&#8217;t
be corrupted, &#8217;less it&#8217;s some one of the other sex, and
even then, corrupted wouldn&#8217;t be exactly the word,
y&#8217;know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, interrupted would be better there,&#8221; Donovan
replied, as the others laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why d&#8217;you want to vote for a fellow like Kelly?&#8221;
Blanche asked. &#8220;He&#8217;s just a wind-bag&mdash;always telling
how much he&#8217;s going to do for the public, but that&#8217;s
where he ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kossler lifted his eyebrows&mdash;women were not supposed
to be interested in politics (middle-aged club-women,
and professionals in both parties, and socialists
excepted).</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, girlie, what d&#8217;you know about it?&#8221; he asked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
indulgently. &#8220;They&#8217;ve all got to promise a lot&mdash;that&#8217;s
in the game&mdash;but old Kelly&#8217;s better than the rest of
them at that. He&#8217;s dead honest and he can&#8217;t be
bought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8217;s &#8217;n elephant,&#8221; Blanche retorted. &#8220;You can
buy one cheap at the Bronx zoo and put him up at the
next election.&#8221;</p>

<p>Donovan looked pityingly at her and said: &#8220;My
Gawd, another socialist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not, but I come from the Hell&#8217;s-Kitchen district
and I&#8217;m wise to politics, all right,&#8221; Blanche answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything you say is right with me,&#8221; Simmonds
interjected. &#8220;It&#8217;s a foxy-pass, anyway, to argue with
a woman at a party&mdash;you&#8217;ll end up by singing: &#8216;Sitting
in a co-orner, that&#8217;s all I do-o.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it is,&#8221; said Blanche, while the others
laughed.</p>

<p>Flo and Grace regarded her with a petulant suspicion&mdash;she
was of the smart, snippy kind, and furthermore,
she&#8217;d better not try to go after <i>their</i> men; they&#8217;d
pull her hair out if she did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you all stop razzing my Blanche,&#8221; Campbell
broke in. &#8220;She&#8217;s just a little girl trying to make both
ends connect in the big, wicked city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Razzing her!&mdash;it&#8217;s just the other way,&#8221; Simmonds
said. &#8220;D&#8217;you ever balance a hot coal on the tip of
your nose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It only looks that way&mdash;I was out on a party last
night,&#8221; Campbell replied. &#8220;I heard a good one, though,
the other day. Tom Jarvey was walking along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
street, and he runs into Hammond, the village cut-up.
&#8216;I hear you was seen walkin&#8217; with your grandmother
the other day&mdash;that&#8217;s a nice thing to do,&#8217; said Hammond.
Jarvey comes back: &#8216;She didn&#8217;t look that way
when I married her&mdash;you know how it is.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The rest of them laughed, and Grace said: &#8220;That&#8217;s
like the husband I ditched last year. He was a prize-package
until I saw him putting his false toofies in a
glass uh water one night. Hot snakes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s call it a draw and put the phonograph on, and
fox-trot,&#8221; Flo said.</p>

<p>The party broke into dancing, with regular intervals
in which rounds of cocktails circulated. The silently
dark woman sat on a couch, with a fixed smile, and
occasionally chatted with Donovan, and seemed to
be outside of the party, as though she were viewing
it with a satiated and good-natured patience. Blanche
sat beside her for a short time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to be enjoying yourself,&#8221; Blanche
said, &#8220;or maybe this is how you do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m a good listener, and I don&#8217;t dance if I can
help it,&#8221; Madge Gowan replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m not down on the
world, it&#8217;s not that, but I like to sit in the audience
now &#8217;n&#8217; then. It&#8217;s fine for your nerves and you get a
different slant at what&#8217;s going on around you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little like that, myself,&#8221; Blanche answered,
&#8220;but this is my night for mixing in, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Campbell pulled her away for another dance, and
she reflected on the dark woman, through the touch of
haze forming in her own head. Was that the way you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
became around thirty-five, if you couldn&#8217;t stay blind
to the world and the people in it?</p>

<p>The party became more boisterous, and the innuendoes
grew warmer and less attired, and the chorus
girls sat beside Kossler and Simmonds and exchanged
kissing and impolite embraces that were not quite
direct. Donovan had his head on Madge Gowan&#8217;s
shoulder, while she caressed his hair. Blanche, who
was standing beside the phonograph, with Campbell&#8217;s
arm around her waist, felt confused, and merrily indifferent
to everything except the unsteady exaltation
in her body and the singing carelessness of her emotions.
As she had done so many times before, she made
an effort to pull herself together and resume some portion
of her secret wariness, but the effort was a weak
one, this time, and her &#8220;silly,&#8221; lightly unarmored feelings
persisted and grew stronger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s leave, Joe dear, I&#8217;m so-o-o diz-z-zy,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down a while, you&#8217;ll feel better,&#8221; he replied,
leading her to the couch.</p>

<p>The two chorus girls departed with Kossler and Simmonds,
after a loudly gay <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> of words had flown
back and forth, and Blanche, by this time, was too
limp and dazed to bid them good-bye. When Donovan
returned from the front door, Blanche had slumped
back upon the couch, and Campbell said: &#8220;Darned
if she hasn&#8217;t passed out, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Donovan grinned at his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll put her on the bed in the spare room and let
her sleep it off. I&#8217;m going to turn in, now, with Madge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
Don&#8217;t do anything your mother wouldn&#8217;t approve of,
Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge Gowan rose and looked steadily at Campbell.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about leaving the poor kid alone, to-night?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish, she&#8217;s &#8217;n old flame uh mine,&#8221;
Campbell answered. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been crazy about each
other for more than two years now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let her sleep with me, anyway,&#8221; Madge persisted.
&#8220;You can see her to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Ma-adge, don&#8217;t butt in where it&#8217;s not needed,&#8221;
said Donovan chidingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, cut out the guardian-angel stuff,&#8221; Campbell
said, in a careless voice. &#8220;She&#8217;s &#8217;n old sweetie uh mine,
I&#8217;m telling you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge turned and looked down at Blanche, in a
dully sad way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, it&#8217;s no business of mine,&#8221; she said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Blanche woke up on the next morning, she
looked at the strange room with an uncomprehending,
ferocious ache in her head. Then, in a detached fashion,
incidents of the past night began to bob up in her
head, and she pieced them slowly together, in a stumbling,
erratic way. She&#8217;d met Campbell and gone to a
party with him, and then she had become drunk and
everything had grown slowly darker. She remembered
vaguely that she had begged him to take her
home.... Then, an indefinable stirring within her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
heart told her what had happened.... So, he had
sneaked off, afraid to face her now&mdash;the coward, the
coward. But perhaps he was still in the place, and ...
where was she, anyway? She opened the door and
walked unsteadily down the hallway. Yes, this was the
same parlor where the party had taken place&mdash;same
piano and furniture. Perhaps Campbell was sleeping in
another room in the apartment.</p>

<p>She returned to the room that she had left, and sat
down. The pain in her head gave an added edge to
the anger within her. The skulking meanness of it&mdash;oh,
she&#8217;d love to break his head in two! Then another
voice within her said: &#8220;You know perfectly well that&#8217;s
what almost any man&#8217;ll do, &#8217;specially &#8217;f he&#8217;s drunk, as
well as you are. Don&#8217;t act like a school-kid&mdash;you knew
it all the time, but you kept on drinking last night,
long past your limit ... fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her anger against Campbell subsided to a more
practical disgust. If she had loved him, she would
not have minded this finale, but as it was she felt like
a swindled imbecile. Campbell would have to be put
in his place once more, and treated with a cool aloofness.
He had benefited by an accident wedded to her
own weakness, and the only grim satisfaction left would
be to ignore him from now on. She didn&#8217;t blame him,
particularly&mdash;all men seemed to be cut out of the same
stuff&mdash;but it would have to be impressed upon him
that his victory had been an empty one, and that she
was still her own mistress. After all, she still felt intact
and undisturbed&mdash;it would take more than a
dozen Campbells to break her spirit&mdash;and she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
sever her relations with him merely as a matter-of-fact
self-protection.</p>

<p>When she had washed, and dressed herself, she
walked back to the parlor and pulled back the shades
at the window, and looked down at the street far below.
It was crowded with people and vehicles&mdash;the hour
might be around noon. She glanced back at a clock
on the top of the sideboard. Eleven-thirty&mdash;she would
have to telephone the &#8220;Parlor&#8221; and give them the old
illness-excuse.... Where had every one disappeared
to&mdash;where was Donovan, who lived in the apartment?
She heard the front door close, and she sat down,
waiting, and shrinking a little ... she didn&#8217;t care to
meet any one at this exact moment. Campbell walked
into the parlor, and when he saw her, he greeted her
with a solicitous joviality.</p>

<p>&#8220;We-ell, there she is&mdash;fresh as a daisy &#8217;n&#8217; everything,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve bought some stuff and we&#8217;ll
cook breakfast on Jack&#8217;s little electric stove. He&#8217;s
still dead to the world, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose from the chair, without answering, and
walked to the hallway, where she removed her coat and
hat from the rack and started to put them on. He
followed her and dropped a hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what&#8217;s up?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re never going to see each other again,&#8221; she
replied, &#8220;and I&#8217;m not very anxious to talk to you.
I don&#8217;t blame you for anything, but you&#8217;re not the
kind of a man I&#8217;m looking for. You&#8217;re just no better
&#8217;r worse than most people, that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;d feel just the
same about it &#8217;f you hadn&#8217;t acted like you did. I held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
on to you because you could make me laugh and forget
my troubles, but I knew it couldn&#8217;t last much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t act like desp&#8217;rate Tessie in a movie-film,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Come on, sit down and let&#8217;s talk it over.
Nothing so terrible has happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying about what happened,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;&#8217;F I cared for you I wouldn&#8217;t give it a
thought. I don&#8217;t, though, and there&#8217;d be no use in
risking a second dose of the same fool stunt. We&#8217;ll
call it quits now, and stop seeing each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got something to tell you, and it won&#8217;t
hurt you to sit down a minute and listen,&#8221; he urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, just a few minutes, and then I&#8217;ll be going,&#8221;
she said, wearily.</p>

<p>They sat on opposite chairs in the parlor, and as
he looked at her, an irresistible impulse came to him.
She certainly did have a marvelous spirit and independence&mdash;no
girl of his acquaintance had ever acted
with such a careless, untouched remoteness on the
morning after, unless she was a plain hooker&mdash;not in
a way that convinced you of its genuineness, at any
rate&mdash;and, strangely enough, as he sat here now, she
was still as desirable as she had ever been. Well,
guess he would have to take the plunge&mdash;you couldn&#8217;t
resist it forever. The old chain-and-jail wind-up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to marry me, Blanche,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
go down to the Municipal Building with you this afternoon,
and we&#8217;ll get the license. I mean every word of
it. You&#8217;re an ace-high full to me and I can&#8217;t give you
up. I guess I&#8217;ve always been in love with you, but
I didn&#8217;t want to admit it to myself. You&#8217;ll marry me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
to-day and we&#8217;ll live happy ever afterwards, just like
they do in the books.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her with a confident, admiring smile,
as though her assent were predetermined. She arose
and smiled pityingly at him, as she tucked her hair
beneath her hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Joe, I wouldn&#8217;t marry you on a bet,&#8221; she
replied. &#8220;You prob&#8217;bly think I&#8217;ve been egging you on
to ask me all the time, and there&#8217;s where you&#8217;ve made
a big mistake, Joe Campbell. &#8217;F I ever marry any
man I&#8217;ll have to be wild about him, and &#8217;f I am, I
won&#8217;t even care so much whether he marries me &#8217;r not.
And, what&#8217;s more, I&#8217;ll have to have a pile of respect
for his mind, and I&#8217;ll have to feel like listening to what
he says, all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at her, without answering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s no use talking any more,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So
long, Joe, I&#8217;m going now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had expected that she would first doubt the
sincerity of his proposal and then eagerly accept him.
He still believed that she was merely leading him on,
to revenge herself, and that all of her words had been
said for their effect, and that she only wanted him to
be persistently begging and humble. He followed her
into the hallway, and caught her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for what happened last night,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it up to you, Blan. I mean it, dear. I&#8217;m
crazy about you, and I want to make you happy, and
I&#8217;ll do anything you say. Why, I&#8217;ll even stop drinking,
if you say the word. You&#8217;ve just got to marry me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
you&#8217;ve got to, Blanche. You know you care for me,
you know you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better guess again, Joe,&#8221; she said, coolly,
as she broke away from him. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to see
you again, and what&#8217;s more, don&#8217;t pester me with any
&#8217;phone-calls &#8217;r letters, either. It won&#8217;t do you a bit of
good.... Good-bye, and good luck, old boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>It gave her a surface thrill to slap his face in this
dramatic and careless fashion. He thought that he
was a precious catch, didn&#8217;t he? Well, he might lose
some of his huge conceit after she had finished with
him.</p>

<p>He caught her arm once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, you&#8217;ve razzed me enough now, haven&#8217;t
you?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been taking it like a man, but
don&#8217;t smear it on so thick. Come on, be good to me,
Blanche.&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke away again and walked swiftly down the
hallway. He started after her and then halted, still
and perplexed, as she reached the door. Then a rage
quickly possessed him&mdash;imagine, this hussy turning
<i>him</i> down after he had been really anxious to make
amends.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then, you can go to hell for all I care,&#8221;
he called after her, as she was passing through the
doorway.</p>

<p>She made no reply as she slammed the door behind
her&mdash;he could have said that immediately and spared
himself the trouble of his other words. These men,
they thought that all they had to do was to utter the
magical words&mdash;ma-arry me&mdash;and a girl would be delighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
at the rare, luring condescension and instantly
fall into their arms. Well, perhaps he wouldn&#8217;t be quite
so conceited from now on&mdash;the cheap sneak. When
she married a man it would be soberly and of her own
free will, because she longed to hear his words, and be
physically near him, and because she looked up to his
mental gifts, and good taste, and re-fine-ment. Oh,
ye-es, in a way she was an idiot for not having accepted
<i>Campbell&#8217;s</i> proposal, since he could certainly have
given the leisure and opportunities which she craved,
but ... she&#8217;d be damned if <i>she</i> would ever marry a
man just because she was ashamed to leave him on the
day after a drunken party!</p>

<p>After she had telephoned the &#8220;Parlor&#8221; and told
Madame Jaurette that she could not come down because
of an intense toothache, she returned to her
home. Her mother had gone to the butcher shop and
Mabel was sitting alone in the living-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sma-artie, where&#8217;ve you been all night?&#8221;
Mabel asked. &#8220;Ma was in a awful stew about you&mdash;she
was gonna call up the p&#8217;lice, but I stopped her.
An&#8217; <i>pa</i>, he&#8217;s gonna ask you <i>some</i> questions when he gets
back, believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all the fuss about?&#8221; Blanche asked, wearily.
&#8220;I went to a wild party and passed out, and they had
to let me sleep there overnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Joe Campbell, he got lost in the crush, &#8217;r else
he went back to his place to sleep, I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; Mabel
answered, sarcastically. &#8220;You c&#8217;n tell it to ma but not
to me. I never thought you&#8217;d give in to him that easy,
Blan. He hasn&#8217;t asked you to marry him, has he?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;Yes, but I turned him down,&#8221; Blanche replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turned him down&mdash;well, of all the fool things,&#8221;
Mabel cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;re jes&#8217; sayin&#8217; you did &#8217;cause
you don&#8217;t want to admit what a simp you&#8217;ve been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s true ... he wanted to marry me right this
afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mabel was silent for a moment, as she regarded her
sister with an irritated surprise, and then she said:
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me guessing. Here&#8217;s a fine fella, not so
bad-lookin&#8217; either, an&#8217; you&#8217;ve been goin&#8217; with him, off
and on, f&#8217;r over two years, an&#8217; he&#8217;s got loads of
money, an&#8217; ... you won&#8217;t marry him. There&#8217;s darn few
fellas that&#8217;ll ask a girl right after they&#8217;ve slipped one
over on her. What&#8217;re you waitin&#8217; for, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for anything you could understand,&#8221; Blanche
responded. &#8220;When I marry a man I&#8217;m going to love
him first&mdash;that&#8217;s what you can&#8217;t get into your head&mdash;and
it&#8217;ll have to be real love, too, and not just because
he has a handsome face and knows how to kid now and
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why&#8217;d you stay with Joe last night?&#8221; Mabel
asked. &#8220;&#8217;F you&#8217;re so darn up&#8217;n the air about it, you
didn&#8217;t have to peel your clothes off f&#8217;r a fella you don&#8217;t
care about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I passed out of the picture, and the next thing I
knew it was morning,&#8221; Blanche said, trying to be patient
with this querulous, unseeing sister of hers, but
feeling a rising strain.</p>

<p>It was bad enough that it had happened&mdash;why did
she have to paw over the details?</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he played a dirty, rotten trick on you then,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Mabel answered, indignantly, &#8220;an&#8217; &#8217;f it was me, I&#8217;d sure
get back at him some way. &#8217;F I didn&#8217;t wanna marry
him, then I&#8217;d scare him outa his wits an&#8217; make him
come across with plenty uh money, I would. &#8217;R else
I&#8217;d see he was sent to the hospital f&#8217;r a nice, long
stretch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was my fault just&#8217;s much as his,&#8221; Blanche replied,
dully. &#8220;No man&#8217;s &#8217;n angel, and a girl shouldn&#8217;t
get drunk with him &#8217;f she doesn&#8217;t want to go the limit.
I can usually take care of myself, but I took too many
cocktails last night. I was feeling blue and forgot when
to stop. &#8217;F you want to do me a favor, then you&#8217;ll talk
about something else. I&#8217;ll never see him again, and
he doesn&#8217;t matter to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try an&#8217; talk to you,&#8221; Mabel responded, disgustedly.
&#8220;The last person you ever look out f&#8217;r is yourself.
You ought to be sent to the booby-hatch!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blanche went into her room without answering ...
what was the use? Mabel meant well enough, but she
couldn&#8217;t see that money and gay times and &#8220;getting
back&#8221; at people were not the only things in the world.</p>

<p>When her mother returned, Blanche pretended to be
asleep, and she remained upon her bed until evening,
with all her thoughts darting about and then hopelessly
evaporating, and with occasional intervals of semi-drowsiness.
When she came to the supper-table, where
the remainder of her family were seated, the firing
started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, give an account uh yourself,&#8221; her father said.
&#8220;Where was you till twelve this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stayed with some friends,&#8221; Blanche answered&mdash;she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
wasn&#8217;t <i>afraid</i> to tell them the truth, of course not,
but she wanted to avoid the senseless wrangling, and
the loud accusations, and the outraged advice that
would ensue if she did. &#8220;I drank a little too much and
I had to sleep it off, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; how about Campbell&mdash;was he with you?&#8221; her
father asked, gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was gone when I woke up this morning,&#8221;
Blanche answered, seeking only to brush aside her
father&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it sounds damn fishy to me,&#8221; her father replied.
&#8220;&#8217;F he did anything wrong to you I&#8217;ll have it
out with him, and he&#8217;ll have to marry you then, &#8217;f
he knows what&#8217;s good f&#8217;r him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say,&#8221; Harry broke in. &#8220;I like Joe
all right, but he&#8217;d better go slow with any sister uh
mine, I don&#8217;t care &#8217;f he was the Gov&#8217;ner himself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting terribly concerned about me all
at once, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; Blanche asked, speaking to
Harry. &#8220;You&#8217;d better not jump at conclusions&mdash;you
don&#8217;t know a thing about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it my business to find out,&#8221; Harry answered,
looking steadily at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m gonna stick up f&#8217;r Blanie this time,&#8221;
Mabel said. &#8220;You&#8217;re both makin&#8217; a big fuss about
nothin&#8217;, an&#8217; what&#8217;s more, you&#8217;ve got no right to be
sayin&#8217; she&#8217;s a bad girl. You oughta be ashamed uh
yourselves. All she did was stay overnight with some
people she knew &#8217;cause she wasn&#8217;t in no condition to
come home. I&#8217;ve done it myself, once &#8217;r twice, an&#8217; you
never waded into me. Blanche may be a nut in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
ways but she&#8217;s not fool enough to let Joe Campbell
put it over on her, an&#8217; you oughta believe her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blanche gave her sister a grateful, surprised look&mdash;Mabel
did have a good streak in her, in spite of her
blind reproaches.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not accusin&#8217; her of anythin&#8217;,&#8221; the father said,
impressed by this defense from his favorite daughter.
&#8220;I only wanted to find out what happened, like any
father would. &#8217;S a matter uh fact, you&#8217;d both better
cut out all this booze you&#8217;re swillin&#8217;. &#8217;F you don&#8217;t,
you&#8217;ll wake up some fine mornin&#8217; an&#8217; find yourselves
in f&#8217;r it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; they oughta stay home more, too,&#8221; the mother
said, breaking in with her endless complaint, not because
she hoped to effect anything, but merely to
maintain her position. &#8220;I was worried to death, I was,
when I got up this mornin&#8217; an&#8217; Blanie wasn&#8217;t here.
You never can tell what&#8217;ll happen to a girl, you never.
Don&#8217;t I read all kindsa things in the paper ev&#8217;ry day&mdash;murders
&#8217;n&#8217; rapes &#8217;n&#8217; what not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that they stay home&mdash;they&#8217;re runnin&#8217; too
loose to suit me, these days,&#8221; the father replied.</p>

<p>He knew that he would do nothing of the kind, but
the words soothed his sense of authority.</p>

<p>When the supper was finished, Blanche put on her
hat and coat, and said: &#8220;I&#8217;m going out for a walk.
I&#8217;ll be back early, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better,&#8221; her father responded. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
swallow another stayin&#8217; over with friends story, this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blanche turned away without replying&mdash;words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
words, and what did they all amount to? Threats, and
promises, and &#8220;reasons&#8221; ... and people scarcely ever
meant them.</p>

<p>After she had left the apartment she strolled aimlessly
up one street and down another, craving the
motion that could add a fillip to the dullness of her
thoughts. Would she ever meet people who could
help her, and who would understand her longings and
prod her with worthwhile criticisms and encouragements&mdash;people,
for instance, as superior to Rosenberg
as Rosenberg had been to the rest of the men whom
she knew? How could she run across them?... As
she walked along, different men stopped beside her
for a moment, with their &#8220;Nice evening, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
and &#8220;You look sorta lonesome, how about it?&#8221; and
&#8220;Pardon me, but haven&#8217;t I met you somewhere before?&#8221;
and &#8220;D&#8217;you mind if I talk to you a while?&#8221;
Sometimes they called to her from automobiles, but
they were merely irritating reminders of a real and
grossly intruding world, and she ignored them&mdash;it
never paid to take a chance, for they always turned
out to be common and cheap. It stood to reason&mdash;why
would an enticing man be so &#8220;hard up&#8221; that he would
have to solicit women on the street?</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t know where she was going, but she
wanted to imagine that she was searching for some destination
that would greet her unexpectedly&mdash;a vague,
half-laughed-at hope&mdash;and she kept on strolling down
the hard, flatly dirty, noisy streets.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night became thickly intense, and all the angular
details and flat expanses of each street&mdash;neither
hideous nor beautiful but vapidly and rigidly perched
in between&mdash;took on the least touch of glamor. Some
semblance of a darkly plaintive heart began to sway
and quiver within the scene, as though the essence
of all these human beings pacing down the sidewalks
and sitting or standing in shops, cars, and restaurants,
had joined the night and formed another quality&mdash;expectations,
illusions, and promises, all electric in the
air. The harshly dreamless industries and shallow
loiterings of the day were replaced by an effort at
romance, soiled but persistent, and a sensual pride
preening itself with gallantries, and a confusion of
cruel or softly dozing confidences.</p>

<p>The moving-picture theaters, in dots of red, yellow,
blue, and green light, made proclamations of spurious,
quickly attained love, adventure, and suspense; the
United Cigar Stores, framed by red and gold, displayed
their mild, brown opiates, while within them
deferential clerks catered to jovial or importantly sullen
men and women; the restaurants, with food heaped
in their windows, and glistening fronts, were filled
with people intent upon turning a prosy stuffing into an
elaborate, laughing ritual; and even the Greek lunch-rooms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
with their stools beside half-dirty glass counters,
and nickel coffee-urns, assumed a hang-dog grin.</p>

<p>Taxicabs in all the cardinal colors darted about,
like feverish insects serving human masters, and the
people in them&mdash;lazy, or impatient, or bored, or out
for a lark&mdash;made a blur of faces sometimes glimpsed
more distinctly as the cabs stopped or slowed down.
Policemen in dark blue uniforms stood at street-crossings,
with tired aggressiveness, looking for a chance
to invest their flunky-r&ocirc;les with a rasping authority.
Motor-trucks lurched along like drab monsters barely
held in leash. Lights were everywhere&mdash;in shops, on
iron poles in the streets, mellowly staring from upper
windows&mdash;desperately seeking to dismiss the darkly
fearful mystery of the surrounding night, but never
quite overcoming it.</p>

<p>Street-cars and &#8220;L&#8221; trains crawled on, soddenly
packed with under-dogs going to their dab of rest or
crude pleasure. A roar was in the air, with immediate,
sharp sounds trailing out into it&mdash;a complaining,
shackled savage floating up from the scene. The large
buildings were without individuality, except that some
of them rose vertically above the others, and in their
dull shades of red, brown, and gray, they would all
have presented a yawning, meanly barrack-like effect
but for the relieving fancy of their lights. Even the
perpendicular strength of the skyscrapers was marred
by filigreed and overcorniced lines.</p>

<p>To Blanche, the scene was a <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> of delightful possibilities
always just eluding her, and obnoxious intrusions
only too ready to seek her arm. She realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
the transforming effect of the night and said to herself:
&#8220;Say, I&#8217;d never do all this walking if it was
daytime&mdash;funny, how everything gets more attractive
when the night trots along. Guess you can&#8217;t see
things so clear then.... Better chance to kid yourself
along.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she strolled through the outskirts of Greenwich
Village her legs began to feel heavy, and the past
hour seemed to be nothing more than a long, senseless
walk taken within the confines of a large trap.
The light, hazy sensation of searching oozed slowly
out of her body and was replaced by the old hopelessness.</p>

<p>She stopped in front of a batik-shop window and
looked at the soft, intricately veined gaudiness of
the smocks, blouses, and scarves. &#8220;Sorta crazy, yes,
but she&#8217;d like to wear them&mdash;they suited her mood.&#8221;
Another girl was standing beside Blanche, and the
other turned her head and said: &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they beauties,
though. I&#8217;d just love to buy that purple and
green smock there in the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like the blue one better&mdash;the one right next to
yours,&#8221; Blanche answered naturally, but she looked
closely at the other girl.</p>

<p>It was not unusual for strange girls to speak to you
when they were either lonely or just brightly interested
in some little thing, but still you had to be
careful&mdash;sometimes they were &#8220;fast&#8221; players with
men, in need of a feminine accomplice, or grafters intent
on securing some favor or loan. The other girl
had a slender torso and almost slender legs, with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
of her plumpness crowded in the buttocks and upper
thighs. She had singed butterflies on her face and they
gave a light, fluttering pain to her smiles. She had the
rarity of large blue eyes on a duskily pale brown face,
and small, loosely parted lips, and a slight hook on
the upper part of her nose, and curly bobbed brown
hair. In her tan coat trimmed with dark fur, scarlet
turban, and multicolored silk scarf, she seemed to be
a dilettantish, chippy girl, just graduated from the
flapper class.</p>

<p>Blanche noticed something &#8220;different&#8221; in the other
girl and answered her more readily as they continued
their talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you live in the Village?&#8221; the other girl asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m from uptown,&#8221; Blanche answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
heard lots about it, though. I&#8217;d like to meet some of
the int&#8217;resting artists and writers down here. There
must be all kinds of them in the tearooms and places
like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other girl gave her a pitying look.</p>

<p>&#8220;All kinds of fakers, you mean,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;They
know how to brag about themselves, but that&#8217;s where
it ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I thought this was the part of town where
real artists &#8217;n&#8217; writers came together,&#8221; Blanche persisted.
&#8220;Of course, I didn&#8217;t believe they were all great
ones, but I did believe they were all trying to do
something, well, different, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there <i>are</i> some down here, but you don&#8217;t
usually find them in the showplaces or tearooms,&#8221; the
other girl answered, as she and Blanche walked down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
the street. &#8220;Those places are for the mediocrities, and
the pretenders, and the students ... and, oh, yes, the
slummers. People from uptown hunting for something
gayly wicked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you think I&#8217;m a foolish slummer, too,&#8221;
Blanche said, &#8220;but I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;ve just been walking
along and thinking things over. I didn&#8217;t realize where
I was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t being personal,&#8221; the other girl replied.
&#8220;I sort of like the way you talk. Suppose we introduce
ourselves to each other?&#8221;</p>

<p>They traded names and the other girl, Margaret
Wheeler, went on: &#8220;You know, strangers are always
supposed to distrust each other, but I can&#8217;t be annoyed.
Every once in a while I talk to some girl on the
street, and I&#8217;ve started a couple of interesting friendships
that way. I&#8217;m not a Lesbian and I haven&#8217;t any
other designs upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t distrust you at all,&#8221; Blanche answered.
&#8220;I can take care of myself and I suppose you
can, too. You talk like you were intelligent, and I&#8217;d
like to know you better, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Margaret. &#8220;I would be fairly intelligent,
if I didn&#8217;t let some male make an idiot out of me
every few months. I&#8217;m in love with some one now, but
it&#8217;ll wind up like all the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make me feel envious,&#8221; Blanche replied. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever really loved any fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you joking?&#8221; Margaret asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going on twenty-five now, and I couldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
count the infatuations I&#8217;ve had. I&#8217;m not as easy as
I used to be, though. Once upon a time, if a man had
a straight nose, and blond hair, and could recite poetry
and make me believe it was his, that was all I needed.
But no-ow, a man must have some real subtlety, and
ability, and wittiness, before I pay any attention to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the kind I&#8217;ve been looking for,&#8221; Blanche
answered. &#8220;Where on earth do you find them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nowhere in particular&mdash;it&#8217;s a matter of luck. And
don&#8217;t forget that a girl must be unusual herself before
she can attract unusual men, unless they&#8217;re just
anxious to have a party with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;d lose out,&#8221; Blanche said,
heavily. &#8220;I&#8217;m just a ha-air dresser in a beauty parlor,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly don&#8217;t talk like one. Maybe you&#8217;ve
never had much of a chance to be anything different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it&#8221;&mdash;Blanche&#8217;s voice was low and depressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m only a steno myself,&#8221; Margaret answered,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m taking a course in short-story writing at Herbert
College&mdash;three nights a week. I want to tear
off the old veils and tell what people do to each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, maybe I could join it, too,&#8221; Blanche replied,
eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not so strong on grammar, though&mdash;stopped
in my first year at high and went to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can pound <i>that</i> part of it into you. The
main thing&#8217;s whether you have something to say&mdash;something
that&#8217;s not just ordinary and hackneyed.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;I think I have, but ... how do I know,&#8221; Blanche
asked, uncertainly.</p>

<p>They had stopped in front of a tearoom with a
multicolored wooden sign under an electric light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Clara&#8217;s&mdash;one of my hangouts,&#8221; Margaret
said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going in to meet my blond-haired devastator.
Won&#8217;t you come along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;ll be in the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing of the kind&mdash;I&#8217;ll introduce you to some
of the people I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>They entered the place, which occupied the first
floor of a two-storey, attic-topped, brick house.
Kitchen tables and chairs painted pale green and
vermilion lined the walls. Paintings and drawings
were hung everywhere&mdash;cubistic plagiarisms, slovenly
sketches, and illustrations meant for the average
magazine&#8217;s check book but not quite reaching it&mdash;and
a semidim light came from stained-glass bowls hung
from the low ceiling. Some fifteen men and women
were scattered around the two rooms, and a portable
phonograph in the corner was whining one of the
latest fox-trot insinuations&mdash;&#8220;He Never Gets Tired
of Me, No, Boy, Just Never Gets Tired of Me-ee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three men and a woman at a table effusively greeted
Margaret, and after she had introduced Blanche, the
two girls sat down with the others. The third girl,
Dora Ruvinsky, was an unsymmetrically fat Jewess,
with a thin-lipped but salacious face and a shorn disorder
of black hair. Her sex had yielded to a cunning
nightmare of masculinity, and she wore a stiff white
collar, a red cravat, and a man&#8217;s vest and coat. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
spoke in a husky drawl and perpetually slapped the
shoulders of the men beside her. They regarded her
with tolerance contending against a slight aversion.</p>

<p>One of them, Max Oppendorf, a blond-haired man
of thirty, plied her with whisky from a hip-bottle and
strove to trap her into feminine reactions and remarks,
as though he were coldly and listlessly playing
with a desperately hypocritical insect. His narrow,
pale, blue-eyed face glanced around the tables with
pity and repugnance somehow fused into its expression.
A recognized poet and novelist, he was nevertheless
known as a distinguished outcast, ostracized,
attacked, and hated by literary and dilettantish
groups of every variety because of his skillful-tongued
independence, his careless violations of etiquettes
and conventions, and the ravages of his unorthodox
intellect. His clothes were shabby but not
quite untidy, and as he frequently closed his eyes
while speaking, he displayed the contradictory guise
of an aristocratic vagabond.</p>

<p>Men almost invariably detested him, while the reactions
of the women who met him were evenly divided
into a distrustful resentment in one camp and a
loyal adoration in the other. His armor was invulnerable,
save when he became hopelessly drunk, in
which condition he either savagely denounced and
affronted the people around him or became unwontedly
indulgent and gave them simulations of sentimentality
and affectionate attention. These abdications
sprang from his innate indifference to life and most
of its people. Sincerely believing that most men and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
women were beclouded, unsearching, and cruelly
<i>gauche</i> children, alcohol made his indifference to them
more indulgently intent upon distracting itself, and,
when drunk, he stooped to them with loud, mock-arguments,
and exuberant caresses. He felt a moderate
degree of tenderness toward Margaret Wheeler, who
appealed to him as an honest grappler, more unreserved
and mentally edged than most other girls of her
age and occupation. She was violently in love with
him, and they spoke together in tones that were almost
whispers, and stroked each other&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>The second man, Bob Trussel&mdash;a gorgeously effeminate
youth who was known in Village circles for his
not-quite-Beardsleyesque black and whites&mdash;conversed
with Dora, while the third, Ben Helgin, talked to
Blanche.</p>

<p>Ben was a robustly tall man in his early thirties,
with a huge, half-bald head, and dark-brown hair inclined
to be frizzly. His long, pointed nose, severely
arched eyebrows, and widely thin lips gave him the
look of a complacent, pettily cruel Devil&mdash;a street
urchin who had donned the mask of Mephistopheles
but could not quite conceal the leer of a boy intent
upon practical jokes and small tormentings. He was
a master in the arts of dramatic exaggeration and belittling,
never quite telling the truth and never quite
lying, and his immeasurable vanity made him always
determined to dominate any conversation. He had an
Oriental volubility, and people would often sit beside
him for an hour or more and vainly seek to insert a
beginning remark or express an uninterrupted opinion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>One of his favorite devices was to tell anecdotes
about men of his acquaintance, in which the men were
invariably depicted in a childish, ridiculous, or inferior
posture, while he gloated over and embellished the details
of their fancied discomfiture, with a great assumption
of sympathy for the victims. Living in a dream-world
entirely of his own making, he loved to flirt with
visions, conquests, world-shaking concepts, and child-like
boasts. On one morning he would appear among
his friends, describing some plan or idea with a cyclonic
enthusiasm, and on the very next afternoon no
trace of it would remain within his mind. Again, he
would loll in an armchair and announce that a famous
actress of forty had implored him to reside with her
and to become the leading man in her next play, but
he would neglect to mention that the lady in question
was renowned for her generous impulses and included
truck-drivers and cigar-clerks in her overtures. These
impositions caused most people to regard him as an
eel-like <i>poseur</i>, when they were removed from the
persuasive sorceries of his words, and they failed to see
that his gigantic egotism had sincerely hoaxed itself
into the r&ocirc;le of a flitting and quickly ennuied conqueror.</p>

<p>For years he had followed the luring dream of
amassing a large fortune through the creation of dexterously
dishonest stories, plays, and press-agent campaigns,
and while he had accumulated thousands of
dollars in these ways, the dream of wealth persistently
refused to be captured. He lacked the grimly plodding,
blind instinct necessary for such a goal, and his financial
harvests were always quickly gathered and dissipated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
This babbling immersion in the garnering of
money, however, gave him the paradoxical air of an
esthetic Babbitt.</p>

<p>His serious literary creations were original and sardonic
at their best, but frequently marred by a journalistic
glibness which led him into shallow and redundant
acrobatics, or facetious saunterings.</p>

<p>He had known Max Oppendorf for nine years, and
they had passed through a comical fanfare of recriminations,
friendly invitations, sneers, and respects.
Oppendorf secretly disliked him but was at times fascinated
by his charming pretenses of <i>camaraderie</i>, and
the quickness of his mind. At one time, the poet had
broken off with Helgin for three years&mdash;a withdrawal
caused by his discovery of the other man&#8217;s peculiar and
somewhat incredible sense of humor. Penniless, and
afflicted with incipient tuberculosis, Oppendorf had
written to his friend and asked for the loan of two
hundred dollars. A special-delivery letter had flown
back to him, containing an unctuously sympathetic
note and announcing the enclosure of a two-hundred-dollar
check. The rest of the envelope had been empty,
however, and believing that the absence of the check
was merely an absent-minded error, he dispatched another
letter which apprised his friend of the oversight.
In response, Helgin had sent him the following
telegram: &#8220;It was a nice joke&mdash;hope you enjoyed it
as much as I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helgin had a sincere admiration for the other man&#8217;s
work and a veiled, malicious aversion to the poet&#8217;s personal
side. To him, Oppendorf&#8217;s life held a supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
taunt which had to be demolished with falsehoods and
ridicule. The poet&#8217;s unbroken flaunting of moralities,
conventions, and compromises, reminded Helgin that
his own life had not been equally courageous and defiant,
in spite of his endless written shots at average
people and their fears, and that, in his personal existence,
he had frequently prostrated himself before the
very observances which he pilloried, or laughed at, in
his books and conversation. This specter could only
be slain by the effort to jeer at the opposite man&#8217;s episodes
with men and women, and to hold them forth as
clownish and unrewarded capers.</p>

<p>As Helgin sat now, in the boisterous and tawdrily
glassy tearoom, he spoke to Blanche with the gracious
casualness which he always publicly affected with
women. It was a part of his jovially invincible pose
to insinuate that he could have been a perfect libertine
had he chosen to follow that denounced profession, and
that his enormous sexual attractiveness was held in
bondage only by his lack of desire and his ability to
peer through the entire, violent fraud of sex itself. In
the dream-world of his own making, through which
he moved, loftily but genially immune to all criticisms,
adulations, and importunities, women were the potential
vassals whom he disdained to hire.</p>

<p>On the night previous to the present one, his second
wife had departed on a visit to her family in a distant
city, and he had telephoned Oppendorf and arranged
a meeting, prodded by one of the irregular impulses in
which his respect for the other man overcame his
opposite feelings of envy and aversion. Now, he sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
and chatted with Blanche while she listened with an
almost abject attention. This great writer, whose pictures
she had run across on the literary pages of newspapers,
and in magazines, was actually seated beside
her and speaking to her&mdash;it could scarcely be true!
She recalled that Rosenberg had often lauded Helgin,
and that a year previous she had read one of the latter
man&#8217;s novels and had liked its &#8220;difficult,&#8221; thumb-twiddling
style and disliked its patronizing, pitying
attitude toward the feminine characters. Well, when
men wrote about women, or women about men, they
never seemed able to become quite fair to each other.
They were always mushy and lenient, on one side, or
sneering and unsympathetic on the other. She voiced
this thought to Helgin, who advised her to cease
searching for an unhappy medium. To him, she presented
the figure of a worried, heavily questioning
peasant girl, dressed and manicured for a more polite
r&ocirc;le, and he had a whim to lure her into expectant
admirations and play with her stumbling hungers and
wonderings. Usually, he did not waste his time on such
girls&mdash;they were more to Oppendorf&#8217;s liking&mdash;but for
the space of one night he could afford to risk the impending
boredom in a more unassuming manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must get Oppie to compliment you,&#8221; he said,
glancing in the poet&#8217;s direction. &#8220;He does it perfectly.
Women cry for it, babies smile, old ladies jump out of
their chairs. Come on, Oppie, say something about
Miss Palmer&#8217;s hair. What does it remind you of? A
startled ghost of dawn, the visible breath of afternoon?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>Oppendorf turned from his whisperings with Margaret,
and smiled&mdash;a patient but slightly threatening
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ordering a tailormade suit or buying a
box of cigars?&#8221; he asked, sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The comparison isn&#8217;t quite fair to your poetry,
Oppie,&#8221; Helgin answered, in the same sweet voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monseigneur Helgin, apostle of fairness, sympathy,
and tolerance&mdash;know any other good ones, Ben?&#8221;&mdash;the
poet&#8217;s smile shone like a sleeping laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your hair is like a tortured midnight&mdash;that was
a nice line, Oppie,&#8221; Helgin answered pensively, as he
ignored the other man&#8217;s thrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;The actual phrase happens to be &#8216;transfigured midnight,&#8217;&#8221;
Oppendorf said, in an ominously subdued
voice. &#8220;You substituted the word tortured to make
the line meaningless, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sa-ay, wasn&#8217;t that tormented night stuff in The
Duke of Hoboken, Ben&#8217;s last novel?&#8221; Dora Ruvinsky
asked, poking Oppendorf in the side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, among other frantic mendacities,&#8221; Oppendorf
answered, as he looked compassionately at Helgin.
&#8220;The ancient Chinese had an excellent proverb: &#8216;When
your stilettos have failed to penetrate the actual figure,
erect a ludicrous dummy and belabor it with an ax.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chinese usually come to your rescue,&#8221; Helgin
retorted, &#8220;but you don&#8217;t seem to realize that The
Duke of Hoboken is simply a gorgeous and delirious
fantasy. It wasn&#8217;t meant to be an actual portrait of
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>&#8220;Yes, you were more innocent than you imagined,&#8221;
Oppendorf answered, still smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, stop all of this polite quarreling, Maxie,&#8221; Margaret
interposed, as she looked at Helgin with an open
dislike. &#8220;Helgin sits in his little phantom palace,
bo-ored and genial, and when you cave in the walls
he scarcely hears you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your own hearing is just a trifle more adoring,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Helgin asked, as he looked at Margaret with
an expression of complacent malice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it needs to be, if only to counteract yours,&#8221;
Margaret replied, tartly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call it a draw, and let&#8217;s talk about purple chrysanthemums,&#8221;
Oppendorf interjected.</p>

<p>When people persisted in clinging to one subject he
was always reminded of scrubwomen endlessly scouring
a pane of glass, unless the theme was exceptionally
complex.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, can&#8217;t I say something else about the
sweet Duke?&#8221; Trussel asked, as he stroked his hair
with the fingers of one hand. &#8220;It&#8217;s screamingly amusing,
really. Lots of the critics have always attacked
Mr. Helgin&#8217;s books, you know&mdash;called them stilted
and, well, overcynical. That sort of thing. But
no-ow, dear me, what a change! Why, they&#8217;re all
simply showering praise on the dear Duke of Hobok&#8217;.
Of course, there isn&#8217;t any connection between this
change and the fact that little Dukie is supposed to be
a biting caricature of Mr. Oppendorf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course not,&#8221; Oppendorf replied, thoroughly
amused now. &#8220;In the same way, three thoughtful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
chorus girls were observed last night, floating in a
huge balloon as they crossed the peninsula of Kamchatka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People are always talking about the dead,&#8221; Helgin
said, in a bored voice. &#8220;The indecent vagaries of critics
are not interesting to me. They might be vastly engrossing
to some entomologist, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re all a lot of bugs,&#8221; Dora said, as she
caressed Margaret&#8217;s arm while Margaret regarded her
with a resigned look that said: &#8220;Well, I suppose you
<i>must</i> do this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy, and you take yourselves so darn
seriously it gives me a pain!&#8221; Dora continued. &#8220;Come
on, let&#8217;s have another drink and act like human
beings.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation changed to a game in which the
others bantered with Dora and laughed at her amiable
but scoffing retorts. Blanche, who had been bewildered
and almost awe-stricken ever since her introduction
to these people, began to listen and observe with a
clearer, though still strongly respectful, attitude. They
were the people whom she had always longed to meet,
and they knew much more than she did, and they were
bold creators while she was only despairing and partly
tongue-tied, ye-es, but still, they were by no means
perfect. They wasted so much time in slamming each
other as cleverly as they could, and while they were
always good-natured about it, you couldn&#8217;t fail to spy
the malice beneath at least half of their smiles and
remarks. They never expressed any whole-hearted liking,
or sympathy, or placid interest in their reactions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
toward each other, and their talk reminded her of a
game in which each one strove to make his &#8220;comeback&#8221;
a little &#8220;smarter&#8221; and quicker than that of the
others. Yet Oppendorf alone seemed to be different.
The others, with the exception of Margaret, were
always trying to twit or arouse him&mdash;something about
him seemed to plague them almost against their will&mdash;and
never quite succeeding. His eyes were sleepy
and retiring, and he closed them half of the time
during his conversation. When he laughed or raised
his voice now and then, it was in a jerky way, &#8220;like
some one else&#8221; was pulling some strings tied to him.
Funny man ... what had given him this air of tired
sadness? Well, at any rate, she could never fall in
love with him&mdash;he was too much like a careful ghost!</p>

<p>The man whom she loved would have to be robust,
and natural, and, well ... sort of eager to be alive, in
spite of the fact that he knew all about the shams
and meannesses which life held. Yes, that was it ...
he&#8217;d be glad, and a little hopeful, in spite of all the
rotten things he saw and heard.</p>

<p>She began to talk more frankly, her tongue loosened
a bit by the two drinks of whisky that Oppendorf
had given her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, why don&#8217;t all of you just call each other liars
and boobs, and have it over with?&#8221; she asked, with
a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;At an early age, I was confronted by the choice
of using the other side&#8217;s tactics now and then or becoming
a hermit,&#8221; Oppendorf replied, in his deliberate
way. &#8220;I am still direct enough, however, to be ostracized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
by practically every literary party or group in
New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I admire your indignation,&#8221; Helgin said to Blanche.
&#8220;Ride us all on a rail and tell us what vicious double-dealers
we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had decided to egg her on for purposes of entertainment.
&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t have the least effect on any of you,&#8221;
Blanche answered, composedly. &#8220;Besides, I&#8217;m only a
stranger and I really haven&#8217;t any right to criticize.
You&#8217;re all doing things&mdash;real things that amount to
something&mdash;and I&#8217;m just a hair-curler in a Beauty
Shop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, here&#8217;s a tip&mdash;never be modest when men
are around,&#8221; Margaret said, gayly. &#8220;They think little
enough of women as it is, and they&#8217;re <i>always</i> looking
for a chance to walk over us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s too much trouble not to be honest,&#8221;
Blanche retorted, lightly. &#8220;Let them try to wa-alk,
for all I care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever written, or painted?&#8221; Oppendorf
asked, liking the contradiction of her humble brassiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>have</i> fooled around with ideas of being a writer,
but I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t know English well enough for
that,&#8221; said Blanche, uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take up writing, Miss Palmer&mdash;it&#8217;s only an
excuse for laziness,&#8221; Helgin said. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably
why so many young people try to toss off stories and
verses. They have just a bit of imagination and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
don&#8217;t like the prospect of slaving in father&#8217;s shoe store
or helping mother bake the evening pies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be a more important reason than that,&#8221;
Blanche replied, soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s barely possible,&#8221; Oppendorf interjected.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a habit with us to take our profession somewhat
flippantly. That&#8217;s to avoid giving the impression that
we&#8217;re too much in love with ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny, you do manage to give the impression, anyway,&#8221;
Blanche answered, as she made a grimace.</p>

<p>Oppendorf and the others laughed, and Helgin
said: &#8220;So, you&#8217;ve been carrying that little dagger all
the time. Bright gal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all&mdash;just trying to imitate your style,&#8221;
Blanche retorted, merrily.</p>

<p>The others had been regarding her as a meek and
abashed apprentice in their realms, but now they began
to pelt her with more respectful badinage, with the
exception of Oppendorf, who watched her with a sleepy
stare of approval and remained silent. This girl wasn&#8217;t
half stupid at bottom, but just ignorant of many
things.</p>

<p>The group repaired to Margaret&#8217;s nearby studio
and danced to a phonograph and slipped into varying
stages of tipsiness. Helgin did not dance, but sat in
a corner and talked to Blanche. He became mellowly
garrulous and somewhat less malicious, and he regarded
Blanche as a fumbling but slightly diverting
barbarian&mdash;diverting for a night or two at least. They
were mildly interesting as long as they clung to their
ferocious sassiness, but they always wound up by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
becoming girlishly wistful, and pleading, and more disrobed.
He began to tell her anecdotes of his past, in
which he was always laughing, penetrating, and triumphant
at somebody else&#8217;s expense, and she listened
eagerly. My, but this man certainly knew how
to talk! He was always getting the best of people&mdash;you
had to take at least forty per cent off from any
fellow&#8217;s claims in that direction&mdash;but he really was a
great writer, and he knew so many words and handled
them so gracefully.</p>

<p>Urged by a perverse whim, he invited Blanche to
come with him to a party which he had promised to
attend on the following night. The affair was to be
a gathering of literary and theatrical celebrities and
near celebrities, together with their latest fads and
fancies in human form, and it might be amusing to
bring this blunt, would-be highbrowish, young hair-dresser
and see whether the assembled pedestals would
overwhelm her.</p>

<p>While Blanche suspected that he was playing with
her and had only the impulse to grasp a flitting distraction,
she felt delighted at this second opportunity
to meet &#8220;famous&#8221; writers, and artists, and actors, and
as she accepted the invitation she said to herself: &#8220;He
thinks I&#8217;m just a snippy nobody, and he wants to show
me off and then see what happens&mdash;like letting the
puppy run loose in the parlor. Oh, I know. But what
do I care? I might make friends at this party with
two or three people just as intelligent as he is, and
maybe more honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Helgin left her emotionally unaroused, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
was nevertheless dazed by his vocabulary and his
mental swiftness, which she frequently had to stumble
after, and a little flattered by his talkative attention,
in spite of herself. The genially wise-cracking, quizzically
aloof, and patronizing air, which he never deserted,
irritated her but did not drive away the spell
of her attention. After all, he made Rosenberg, the
most intelligent man in her past, sound like a stuttering,
yearning baby. Funny, how you changed! She had
once looked up to this same Rosenberg, as though he
were a luring and puzzling god. Well, that was life&mdash;listening
and clinging to people until you grew beyond
them. The only man whom she could permanently love
would be one always a little superior to her, and urging
her to catch up with him, and kindly waiting a little
now and then, so as not to get too far ahead of her.</p>

<p>When she reached her home she felt tired but &#8220;up in
the air.&#8221; A long, hopeless stroll and a chance acquaintanceship
had really led her into a new world&mdash;it
was like a fairy tale, wasn&#8217;t it? Helgin had
remained in the taxicab, after arranging to meet her
at Margaret&#8217;s studio on the following night, and hadn&#8217;t
even attempted to hold her hand ... not that that
mattered, though she was a little curious to know how
men of this kind &#8220;went about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had refrained from touching her because it would
have disrupted his nonchalant posture&mdash;the meticulous
avoidance of sexual defeat with which he kept his egotism
intact. He was like a watchman, ever alert in
front of a towering but shaky house of cards.</p>

<p>It was 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> when she entered her bedroom, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
her mind was still spinning and darting about, in
spite of her physical weariness, and, moved by an
irresistible desire, and a sudden confidence that had
been born from her surprising evening, she took a pad
of paper from one of her bureau drawers and sat up
in bed until 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, writing a sketch of the tearoom
she had visited, and the people within it. The sketch
was crude and at times ungrammatical, but it had an
awkward sense of irony and humor which clung to
small, insufficient words or hugged inappropriately long
ones, and it was filled with clumsily good phrases such
as: &#8220;They made a lot of noise and then whispered like
they were ashamed of it,&#8221; or &#8220;She had small eyes and
they got smaller when she talked,&#8221; &#8220;She was wearing
a daisy, georgette thing and she acted like it.&#8221; Sturdily,
but with little equipment, her thought bent to
the novel wrestle with words on paper, and she felt an
odd, half-uncertain thrill when she had finished the
sketch. Did it have anything to it, or was it entirely
bad? Well, she&#8217;d show it to Helgin or Oppendorf on
the next night and get ready for the old cleaver.
Nothing like trying, anyway, and curiously, she felt
a beautiful relief now, as though she had emptied herself
for the first time in a way that approached satisfaction.</p>

<p>On the next day she was drowsy but cheerful at the
Beauty Parlor, managing somehow to stagger through
the quick-fingered details of her work, but experiencing
a rising strain. This would never do&mdash;she would
have to be wakeful and at her best for the coming
party. It wouldn&#8217;t be like going out with some silly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
man, feigning to listen to his &#8220;I am it&#8221; gab, and leaving
him around midnight, with several yawns and the
usual, semievaded kiss and hug. Through using the
reliable excuse of serious illness in her family, she
succeeded in leaving the shop at three in the afternoon,
hastening home and sleeping there until nearly
seven. When she sat at the supper-table with the rest of
the family, Harry said: &#8220;Say, I&#8217;ve got some news for
yuh. Ran across Joe Campbell on Broadway an&#8217; had
a long chin-fest with him. He says he begged yuh to
marry him the other night and yuh turned him down
flat, but he&#8217;s still leavin&#8217; the prop&#8217;sition open. Believe
me, I wouldn&#8217;t, if I was him. He asked me to tell
yuh, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How interesting,&#8221; Blanche replied. &#8220;Suppose you
tell your friend, Mister Campbell, to go to the devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Bla-anie, that&#8217;s a nice way to talk,&#8221; her
mother cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed of you, I am. He&#8217;s never
done you no harm, far&#8217;s I know, an&#8217; he&#8217;s been acourtin&#8217;
you for over two years now, an&#8217; besides, he&#8217;s gone an&#8217;
made you &#8217;n hon-rable pruposul. You could do lots
worse than marryin&#8217; him, you could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, have I got to go through this whole thing
over again?&#8221; Blanche asked, exasperated. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
marry Campbell &#8217;f he had ten million and owned the
subway system, and there&#8217;s no sense to this endless
jawing match we put on. You can&#8217;t understand me
and you never will&mdash;it&#8217;s not your fault, you just can&#8217;t,
and what&#8217;s more, you ought to realize it by this time.
I&#8217;m going my own way and you might as well leave
me alone.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>&#8220;Is that so,&#8221; her father replied, with a dull, puzzled
anger shining in his little eyes. &#8220;I-is that so. You&#8217;re
jest a stranger here, I s&#8217;pose, an&#8217; you&#8217;ve dropped in
tuh have supper with us. Sure, that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m not your
father an&#8217; I&#8217;ve got nothin&#8217; tuh say about you, huh?
You&#8217;ve got a lot of nerve f&#8217;r a person your age, you
have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, she&#8217;s gettin&#8217; a swelled head, all right,&#8221; Harry
said. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll have to beat up &#8217;nother one uh her
phony guys, an&#8217; tone her down a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re just full of wind,&#8221; Blanche answered,
indifferently.</p>

<p>Mabel had been listening to Blanche with a mixture
of reluctant loyalty and annoyance&mdash;this &#8220;nut&#8221; sister
of hers was certainly impossible to understand, but
Campbell had &#8220;done her dirty&#8221; just the same, and
Blanche had a perfect right to detest him, and it was
about time that the family stopped nagging her on that
subject. Mabel&#8217;s antagonism against men and her regarding
them as a would-be preying sex made it imperative
that she should be on her sister&#8217;s side in this
question, almost against her will.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know Blan&#8217;s a nut, but stop razzing her about
this Campbell stuff,&#8221; she said, glancing disapprovingly
around the table. &#8220;The way you all rave about him a
person&#8217;d think he was a king &#8217;r something. He&#8217;s just
like other fellows&mdash;waving his dough around an&#8217; trying
to put it over on ev&#8217;ry girl he meets. What do you
want to do anyway&mdash;tie Blan up an&#8217; carry her down to
the license-bureau? She oughta have some rights
around here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Taken aback by this unexpected defense from
Mabel, and not being able to think of any immediate
and adequate retort, in spite of their emotional opposition,
the parents and Harry lapsed into a short silence,
after which they returned to minor complaints and
jovialities. It was easy to battle with Blanche, who
outraged all of their petted hopes and ideas, but when
Mabel contradicted them, their feeling of innate kinship
with her placed them in a temporarily bewildered
state in which they wondered whether they might not
be slightly wrong. Philip, who had squirmed distressedly
in his chair and tried to look unconcerned,
according to his custom, secretly prayed for Blanche
to revolt and leave home. It would be better for her&mdash;she&#8217;d
be happier then, in her crazy but rather likably
independent way&mdash;and if she did there&#8217;d be some peace
around the flat, for the first time.</p>

<p>Blanche, who had felt relieved and a little unwillingly
affectionate as she heard her sister&#8217;s support,
drew back her chair to leave the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going out to-night?&#8221; Philip asked casually, as he
rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m invited to &#8217;n exclusive party ... artists
and actors&mdash;real, famous ones that people talk about,&#8221;
Blanche replied, not being able to resist the desire to
voice her proudly anticipating mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fa-amous, huh,&#8221; Harry said, with a sneer. &#8220;Well,
you&#8217;ll sure be outa place there, &#8217;f they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peddle your wise-cracks somewhere else,&#8221; Blanche
responded, unruffled.</p>

<p>&#8220;We-ell, I don&#8217;t care what they are &#8217;cept that you&#8217;d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
better not come skiddin&#8217; in after breakfast,&#8221; her father
broke in, gruffly.</p>

<p>What his girls did was their business as long as
no one &#8220;had the goods on them&#8221; and they kept out
of trouble, but at the same time he didn&#8217;t intend to
stand for any open flaunting of their possible transgressions.
If a girl came home just before dawn, at the
latest, she might only have been &#8220;cutting up&#8221; at some
wild party or night club, but if she returned later
than that, then it was evident that she had stayed overnight
with some man.</p>

<p>As Blanche stood before her mirror, engrossed in the
half-piteous and half-brazenly hopeful ritual observed
by most women&mdash;that of applying cosmetics to her face&mdash;a
lyric rose and fell in her heart, separated by
skeptical pauses. At last she had a chance to leap from
the greasy, colorless weights of Ninth Avenue, and
the cheaply frothy interludes of Broadway ... but
was it only a fair-faced dream? Would the people in
the other impending world laugh at her, or turn their
backs? Again, all of them might turn out to be qualified
versions of the group she had met at Clara&#8217;s&mdash;mischievous,
sneering Helgins, weak and pouting
Trussels, unwomanly Doras, Margarets indifferent to
every one save the men at their sides, and perhaps
another approach to Oppendorf&mdash;another intriguing
but palely distant figure.</p>

<p>The lyric rose once more and slew the specters.
What an expert she was at borrowing trouble! It was
quite possible that at least two or three of the people
whom she was to meet would act friendly toward her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
and invite her to other gatherings, or perhaps a really
fetching man, more naked and decent than Helgin,
would fall for her.</p>

<p>As she walked down Ninth Avenue to the Elevated
station, the scene incited tinglings of disgust in her
whereas, usually, she regarded it with a passively acceptant
dislike, as the great, solid ugliness from which
she could not escape. Now, different objects in the
scene affected her as though she had been pummeled
in the face. The garbage cans at one side of the entrances,
frequently overbrimming with decayed fruit,
soiled papers, and old shoes and hats; the pillars and
tracks of the &#8220;L&#8221; road, stretching out like a still millipede,
with smaller insects shooting over its back;
frowsy women, with sallow, vacant faces, shouting
down from upper windows; dirt-streaked boys, wrangling
and cursing in hallways; drab blocks of buildings
cramped together, like huge, seething, shoddy boxes;
and clusters of youths on each corner, leering as though
they could scarcely control the desire to leap
upon her.</p>

<p>All of it scraped against her nerves. Why had she
remained so long within it?&mdash;it should have become
unendurable years ago. Well, what choice had she
ever had?&mdash;an unpleasant hall room in some rooming-shack.
She could not afford more than that. But why,
oh, why, was she so depressed on this evening of all
others&mdash;this evening when for the first time she had
something novel and promising to look forward to?
The lyric started again and the black pause terminated.
She became more in tune with an insidious, dodging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
gayety that somehow survived the grossness of Ninth
Avenue and sounded in the mildly warm air of the late
spring evening. In the dark-brown duvetyn dress that
stopped at her knees, black chiffon turban, flesh-colored
stockings and brown pumps, she could almost
have been mistaken for some society girl on a slumming
tour.</p>

<p>When she reached Margaret&#8217;s studio, Helgin and
Oppendorf had already arrived and were immersed in
a game of dice for dimes, while Margaret finished her
toilette. The studio had a low, broad couch covered
with dark green taffeta and batik cushions, and gaudily
painted furniture, and a little kitchenette and bathroom
adjoined it. Helgin greeted Blanche in the affable
boyish way which he could affect for moments&mdash;the
miraculous atom of humility sometimes flitting to
the surface of his poised urbanities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you prepared to be thrilled?&#8221; he asked her,
as she seated herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, I&#8217;m a hard-boiled egg from Hell&#8217;s Kitchen,
and I don&#8217;t thrill so easy,&#8221; she answered, with the impudent
desire to shatter his smiling condescension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, little tough Annie from behind the gas
works,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How did you manage to stuff your
boxing gloves into that vanity case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t need them&mdash;bare knuckles where I come
from,&#8221; she retorted, smiling back at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop it, Ben, you&#8217;ve met your match this time,&#8221;
Oppendorf called out from the armchair where he was
pensively eying a tiny glass of gin held in his right
hand. &#8220;The awkward fighter can always beat the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
clever one if he stands and waits for Sir Cleverness
to rush him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oppie always instructs me&mdash;he can&#8217;t bear the
thought of my being vanquished,&#8221; Helgin replied,
lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know, I <i>have</i> managed to bear it now
and then,&#8221; Oppendorf said, before swallowing the gin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t both of you promise me not to be sarcastic
for one night?&#8221; Margaret asked, as she entered the
studio. &#8220;If I had the muscle, why, I&#8217;d spank the two
of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Start with Ben&mdash;it might change his entire life,&#8221;
Oppendorf said, grinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not so sweet-tempered yourself,&#8221; she replied,
as she pinched his cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite right, I&#8217;m a snarling, vituperative, vindictive
man until your smile creates a miracle within
me,&#8221; he said, as he bowed low to her.</p>

<p>Whenever Oppendorf liked a woman he treated her
at times with a whimsical pretense of courtliness and
deference, merrily overdone enough to make the whimsicality
apparent.</p>

<p>&#8220;How easy it would be to believe you,&#8221; she responded,
with a sigh that carried off the vestige of
a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Emotions are never false&mdash;even the masquerade
must become real before it can be persuasive,&#8221; Oppendorf
answered, quickly changing to a mien of abstracted,
impersonal challenge. &#8220;When the reality survives
for a long time it is called sincere and true, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
people have faith in it. It may be just as real for a
moment, an hour, six days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a sophist and a promiscuous wretch, and I&#8217;ll
probably wind up by hating you,&#8221; Margaret said, as
she slid into his arms. &#8220;Just as a person begins to
depend on you ... you flit away ... I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does a woman hate a man when he departs
with an honest abruptness?&#8221;&mdash;Oppendorf shifted to
the inquiry of a distressed child. &#8220;Or, why do men
hate women for the same reason? I am immersed in
you at present because you contain qualities which
I cannot find in the other women around me. To-night,
perhaps, or in a month from now, I may meet another
woman who does possess them, together with other
qualities which you lack. In such a case, my immersion
would naturally transfer itself. God, how human
beings detest everything except the snug, warm permanence
which is either a lie or an unsearching sleep!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing logical about pain, Max,&#8221; Margaret
said. &#8220;It <i>must</i> be deaf, and angry, and blind,
and pleading, until it dies down. When a girl&#8217;s lover
goes off, her mind can say: &#8216;He revived and stimulated
me, and I&#8217;m glad I did have him for a while,&#8217; but just
the same her heart still cries out: &#8216;Oh, he&#8217;s mean, and
selfish, and treacherous, and I hate him!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Although she was conversing with Helgin, on the
couch, Blanche had caught bits of the other couple&#8217;s
talk, and they brought a worried tinge to her heart.
Oppendorf was wrong&mdash;in very rare cases a man and
a woman <i>could</i> love each other forever. Of course, the
cases were rare simply because people deeply harmonious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
in every way, from their dancing-steps and
tastes in clothes down to the very last opinion in their
minds, hardly ever met each other. That was it. It was
simply a question of luck as to whether you&#8217;d find
this one person in a million or not.</p>

<p>Helgin called out: &#8220;Well, Don Juan&#8217;s defending
himself again. He&#8217;s more convincing when he doesn&#8217;t
talk. Come on, Oppie, stop the necking for a while
and join us. You&#8217;re falling into the boresome habit of
dropping into a lady&#8217;s arms for hours and spoiling
the party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never object to other people taking the same privilege,&#8221;
Oppendorf replied, placidly, as Margaret
slipped from his lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;re not as impatient as you,&#8221; Helgin
said, grinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or perhaps you hide your impatience more patiently&mdash;there
are so many possibilities,&#8221; Oppendorf
retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Oscar Wilde once opened a small-talk shop&mdash;the
store has been well patronized ever since,&#8221; Blanche
said, flippantly.</p>

<p>The line wasn&#8217;t her own&mdash;it had been in the last
novel she had read&mdash;but she wanted to see what its
effect would be on these men, and whether it would
impress them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gal&#8217;s improving,&#8221; Helgin replied. &#8220;Come on,
take off your little costume. You&#8217;re a college-student
trying to write, and you thought you&#8217;d be more interesting
if you posed as a slangy hair-dresser.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>&#8220;The best way to fool you people is not to pose at
all,&#8221; Margaret said, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a bad idea&mdash;I&#8217;ve tried it myself,&#8221; Oppendorf
interjected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ti-ti-tum, come on, let&#8217;s go to the party,&#8221; Margaret
interrupted. &#8220;You can all keep it up on the
way over.&#8221;</p>

<p>After they were all in a taxicab and speeding
uptown, Helgin said to Blanche: &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you give
Oppie a manuscript at the studio?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s something I wrote about the tearoom
where we sat last night,&#8221; Blanche answered. &#8220;He&#8217;s
such a frank man, and I know he&#8217;ll tell me whether
it&#8217;s just trash, or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s becoming very amusing,&#8221; Helgin continued.
&#8220;Nowadays, if you meet a manicurist you never know
when she&#8217;s going to stop polishing your nails and draw
the great, American lyric out of her sleeve, and the
waiter at the caf&eacute; tries to induce you to read his startling,
unpublished novel, and the bootblack shoves a
short-story under your nose. None of these people
would dare to attempt a painting or a sonata. The
popular superstition is that literature consists of a
deep longing plus thousands of words thrown helter-skelter
together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it doesn&#8217;t hurt them to try&mdash;they&#8217;ll never find
out what their ability is, &#8217;f they don&#8217;t,&#8221; Blanche replied,
defiantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, don&#8217;t let him razz you,&#8221; Margaret
broke in. &#8220;Masefield was once a bar-room porter, you
know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>&#8220;Please pick out a better example,&#8221; Oppendorf said.</p>

<p>Then he turned to Blanche.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grammar is atrocious at times, but you have
originality, and there&#8217;s a razor in your humor,&#8221; he
went on. &#8220;Keep on writing, and study syntax and the
declensions of verbs&mdash;they&#8217;re still fairly well observed
by every one except the Dadaists. I&#8217;ll have you in
several magazines in another two months. And thank
God you&#8217;re not a poet. If you were, you&#8217;d get fifty
cents a line, mixed in with profound excuses!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really mean it?&#8221; Blanche asked, delightedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ll work like a nigger &#8217;f I can really make
something of myself as a writer,&#8221; Blanche cried, enraptured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re not giving any pleasant mirages to
Miss Palmer,&#8221; Helgin said, wondering whether Oppendorf
was not merely seeking to flatter her into an
eventual physical capitulation. &#8220;I know your weakness.
When we were getting out The New Age you&#8217;d
plague me every day with verses from girl-friends of
yours, and they were always rank imitations of your
own style.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to have the delusion that every beginner,
with a sense of irony and a deliberate style, is an echo
of mine,&#8221; Oppendorf replied, undisturbed. &#8220;You&#8217;d
treat these people with a flippant impatience, but I&#8217;d
rather err on the side of encouraging them, unless
they&#8217;re saturated with platitudes and gush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you <i>are</i> apt to make such mistakes, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
in the case of some pretty girl,&#8221; Helgin said, with a
malicious grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have it your way, Ben,&#8221; Oppendorf responded, indifferently.</p>

<p>Blanche listened with a serene confidence in Oppendorf&mdash;he
never lied about anything connected with
writing: somehow she felt sure of that. Literature
was too serious a matter to him.</p>

<p>For a moment Margaret looked a little jealously at
Blanche, pestered by the suspicion that Oppendorf
might have praised Blanche&#8217;s work as a first move
toward conquering her&mdash;a suspicion which Helgin had
known would be caused by his words. Then Margaret
remembered how he had viciously assailed her own
short-stories just after her first meeting with him,
when he had known that she would have prostrated
herself before him for the least word of praise, and
with the remembrance her doubts perished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be on your good behavior to-night,&#8221; Helgin said
to Oppendorf. &#8220;Vanderin didn&#8217;t want to invite you,
but I convinced him that you had become a chastened
and amiable gentleman. I wouldn&#8217;t like to see you
thrown down the stairway&mdash;it gives smaller people a
chance to gloat over you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you really as wild as all that?&#8221; Blanche asked,
looking incredulously at Oppendorf&#8217;s subdued pallidness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stairway myth is one in a celebrated list,&#8221;
Oppendorf replied. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find many of the others
in Mr. Helgin&#8217;s affectionate tribute to me&mdash;his last
novel. The list is a superb one. I deceived some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
social-radical friends by pretending to defy the draft
laws during the war. I faked a broken shoulder and
sponged on some other friends. I was caught in the
act of attempting to ravish a twelve-year-old girl. I
leap upon women at parties and manhandle them while
they shriek for mercy, in contrast to the other men
present, who never do more than audaciously grasp
the little fingers of the same ladies. The amusing part
of it is that none of my actual crimes and offenses are
on the list. I could give my admirers some real ammunition
if they would only ask me for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do they tell such hideous lies about you?&#8221;
Blanche asked naively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why,&#8221; Margaret broke in, indignantly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s because they hate him and fear him. He gets
beneath their skins and mocks at all their little idols,
and squirmings, and compromises. They want to pulverize
him, but he hardly ever gives them any real
opportunities, so they&#8217;re reduced to falling back on
their imaginations and insisting that he&#8217;s a clownish
monster. It&#8217;s a beautiful system of exaggerations, all
right! If he happens to be drunk at a party, it&#8217;s immediately
reported that he was pushed down the stairs,
and if he&#8217;s seen stroking a woman&#8217;s arm it&#8217;s always
said that he hu-urled himself upon her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be troublesome to hear your perfect lover
so sadly maligned in spite of his eloquent assertions
of innocence,&#8221; Helgin said, smiling. &#8220;Most of the
stories are really told in admiration of his savage
gifts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the admiration is both profound and imaginative,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Oppendorf retorted, with a weary return of the
smile.</p>

<p>Blanche listened to the others with feelings of uncertainty
and dismay. How could refined, serious,
artistic people act so rottenly toward each other?
They weren&#8217;t so very much different from the toughs
in her neighborhood, except that they used words
while the gangsters and bullies employed their feet
and fists, or fell back on guns and knives. The gangsters
were far less dangerous, too. They could only
hurt a person for a short time, or else kill him and
send him beyond any further injury, but these artist-people
with their mean tongues and their sneering
stories could damage some one for the rest of his life,
in different ways. Oh, well, maybe most people were
always alike, except that some of them were clever
and had minds, while others were more inept and
stupid. What real difference was there between the
endless digs which her new acquaintances traded and
the catty remarks which she heard every day at the
Beauty Parlor? Still, she made a mental reservation
in the case of Oppendorf. He had to retaliate or keep
quiet, and he never started any of the sarcasm, as
far as she could hear, though he certainly could finish
it! If he had only been physically stronger, and more
blithely animated, she could have fallen in love with
him. This ideal man of hers!&mdash;she&#8217;d probably never
meet him. It only happened in story-books. But, at
any rate, she intended to apply herself to writing and
feel of some importance for a change. How relieved
and happy she had been after putting down the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
word of her tearoom sketch&mdash;it had been almost the
first real thrill in her life.</p>

<p>When she entered Paul Vanderin&#8217;s large, high-ceilinged
studio and spied the Juliet balcony that ran
around two sides of it, with rooms leading out on the
balcony, and the profusion of statues and paintings&mdash;most
of them weird or fiercely unorthodox&mdash;and the
grand piano, and the abundance of luxurious furniture
in neutral shades, she sighed and slipped a hand
over her eyes. How delirious it must be to live in a
place of this kind&mdash;big, and high, and filled with conveniences
and intensely interesting objects&mdash;and how
different it was from her own small, ugly room, with
the ceiling hemming you in as though you were in a
cage. Life was so darned unfair&mdash;lavishing favors,
and stimulations, and beauties on some people and
treating others in the most grudging and miserly fashion.
Well, that was an old story&mdash;no good to rave
over it. You had to beat life to its knees somehow,
sharpening your mind and trying to express yourself,
and praying for luck.</p>

<p>Several people had already gathered in the studio,
and as she walked beside Helgin in the round of introductions,
she opened her mouth and felt stunned at
the discovery that some of them ... were negroes!
This was really astonishing&mdash;she had never dreamt
that cultured, artistic white people mingled with black
and brown men and women on terms of familiar friendship!
Her head felt in a turmoil and she couldn&#8217;t decide
whether these contacts were right or wrong,
whether she herself could join them without shrinking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Of course, human beings were all equal and shouldn&#8217;t
look down upon each other because the color of their
skins varied, but ... didn&#8217;t it go much deeper than
that? Wasn&#8217;t there a physical repugnance between the
different races&mdash;a strong feeling that simply couldn&#8217;t
be overcome? Certainly, she had always thought so.</p>

<p>She had spoken to negroes, and Japanese, and
Chinamen before, and had even joked with them&mdash;elevator
boys, and porters, and waiters, and laundry-men&mdash;but
she had never cared for their physical proximity
and had always felt repulsed if they happened to
brush against her. But still, they had been unrefined
and ordinary, while these negroes were intelligent and
cultured, and spoke about art and psychology. This
was a revelation, as she had never imagined that
negroes of this kind existed, except in the ratio of one
to tens of thousands. She had heard vaguely of Booker
T. Washington, and famous negro lawyers, and, oh
yes, a negro writer named Du Bois, whom Rosenberg
had always talked about, but she had thought that
they were rarities and had even felt a flitting pity for
their isolation among their own race.</p>

<p>Of course, she had been foolish and thoughtless&mdash;there
was no valid reason why negroes should not
voice their feelings and search for beauty and uniqueness,
instead of always clinging to some business or
manual labor. They were human beings, too, and
their hearts and minds were probably often much
more restless than those of most white people. Besides,
since these white writers and artists mixed with
negroes, it must be that society was gradually beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
to approve of this union and was losing its prejudice
in the matter. Sti-ill, perhaps these negroes and
whites simply talked to each other, or danced together,
without any sexual intimacies. Surely, there
was no harm in that.</p>

<p>As she sat beside Helgin she voiced her perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I never knew that black and white people
went to the same parties,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t quite
know what to think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it&#8217;s the latest fad among white dilettantes,&#8221;
Helgin replied. &#8220;They became weary of their other
enthusiasms&mdash;finding a tragic, esthetic beauty in Charlie
Chaplin and other slapstick comedians, and raving
over East Side Burlesque Shows, and making Greek
gladiators out of flat-nosed prize-fighters, and hunting
for love in Greenwich Village. They are now
busily engaged in patronizing and eulogizing the negro
race. Vanderin is one of the ring-leaders in the matter.
It tickles his jaded senses and reassures him of his
decadence, and provides him with material for
novels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t any of it sincere and honest?&#8221; Blanche
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly&mdash;negro and white writers and artists are
actually starting to tear down the age-old barriers,&#8221;
Helgin responded. &#8220;What begins as a fad can end as
an avalanche. I really hope it happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But ... but tell me, do negro and white men and
women have anything to do with each other?&#8221; Blanche
asked, falteringly.</p>

<p>Helgin laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>&#8220;Do you see that couple over there?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;The tall, Nordic kid and the mulatto girl in red.
They&#8217;re always together at every party. Of course,
white men have had negro mistresses in the past, with
everything veiled and a little shamefaced, but this is
different. It&#8217;s out in the open now, and it&#8217;s on the
basis of deep mental and spiritual understanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be narrow-minded,&#8221; Blanche answered,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t see how they can love each other&mdash;they
must be lying to themselves. The races just
weren&#8217;t meant to have physical relations with each
other. There&#8217;s something, something in their flesh and
blood that stands between, like ... like a warning
signal. That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke, though, she had the sensation of uttering
sentences which she had borrowed from books
and other people, and which did not decisively express
her opinions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it doesn&#8217;t last long, usually,&#8221; Helgin said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not often that they live permanently together
and raise families, but the infatuations are fierce
enough while they last. And even intermarriage is
becoming more common.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We-ell, I&#8217;d like to talk to a negro boy, &#8217;f he were
intelligent and brilliant-like, you know, but I don&#8217;t
think I could fall in love with him, even then,&#8221; Blanche
replied. &#8220;You can&#8217;t reason about it ... it&#8217;s there,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vanderin walked up and spoke to Blanche. He was
a tall, robust man with gray hair and a half-bald head
and a ruddy, mildly sensual face. His speech and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
manners were genially suave and yet reserved, and
there was something about his large eyes that resembled
the look of a child playing with toys to hide its
weariness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind our mixed gathering, I hope,&#8221; he
said to Blanche. &#8220;I find the negro race to be very congenial,
and just beginning to wake up. There are negro
painters and poets here to-night who are quite able to
stand shoulder to shoulder with white creators.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us all about their plaintive, erotic, defiant
quality,&#8221; Helgin said. &#8220;You do it well, Paul&mdash;come
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vanderin laughed as he retorted: &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to
read it in my next book, old skeptic. I&#8217;m not giving
lectures to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t you tell me something about them?&#8221;
Blanche asked, pleadingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m a frightful simpleton
in all these matters, but I do want to find out about
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helgin rose and joined a group, while Vanderin sat
down and conversed with Blanche. He fascinated her
as he told her grotesquely humorous, slightly bawdy
anecdotes of Harlem&#8217;s night life and spoke of cabarets
where negroes and whites danced and frolicked with a
savagely paganish abandonment, and described the
motives and longings behind negro music and writing.
According to Vanderin, negroes were pouncing upon
the restrained and timorous art of America and revitalizing
it with an unashamed sensuality, and more
simple and tortured longings, and a more grimly questioning
attitude of mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>As Blanche listened to his silkenly baritone voice she
reproached herself for her lack of a warm response
toward this persuasive, exotic man. His mind intrigued
her but her heart still beat evenly. She seemed
to sense something of a huge, amiable, carelessly
treacherous cat within him&mdash;one who lazily and perversely
hunted for distractions and amusements, without
allowing anything or any one to move him deeply,
and who could become cruel or disdainful in the tremor
of an eyelash. Why did all of the mentally luring men
she had ever met fail to overpower her emotions? So
far, her heart had been moderately stirred only by
mental weaklings or frauds. Oh, dear, this business
of searching for an ideal was certainly a shadowy
mess!</p>

<p>Vanderin excused himself to greet some new arrivals,
and Margaret dropped into his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you like the hectic fricassee?&#8221; she asked,
half waving her hand toward a boisterous group of
negroes and whites, who stood with arms interlocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very confused about it,&#8221; Blanche said. &#8220;One
part of me, now, it says, &#8216;Come on, Blanie, be a good
sport and don&#8217;t be prejudiced,&#8217; but there&#8217;s another
part, you see, and it sort of shrinks away, and wonders,
well ... and wonders how they can kiss and hug
each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, you ain&#8217; seen nothin&#8217; yet,&#8221; Margaret answered,
jocosely. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been to parties where white
and colored people were doing everything but, and
they weren&#8217;t lowbrows, either. Real artists, and writers,
and actors.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;Well, how do you feel about it?&#8221; Blanche asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do it myself, but I&#8217;m not intolerant,&#8221;
Margaret said. &#8220;Some people have this instinctive,
physical aversion to other races, you know, and some
just haven&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve talked to colored men for hours
and felt very immersed in what they said, but I could
never have spooned with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m probably built the same way, but I&#8217;m
not at all sure about it,&#8221; Blanche responded. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not sure about anything, to-night. It&#8217;s all too new to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tall, jaunty, colored youth whisked Margaret
away, and a portly, courtly man wearing shell-rimmed
spectacles sat down beside Blanche and began to tell
her all about an immortal play which he had written,
but which the managers were hesitating over because
it hadn&#8217;t strolled into the box-office. The playwright
was garrulous, using his arms as a sweeping emphasis
for his remarks, and Blanche wondered whether she
was listening to a genius or an untalented boaster.
Some day she&#8217;d meet a man who didn&#8217;t claim to be
superb in his particular line ... some day snow would
fall in July.</p>

<p>The gathering became slowly silent as Vanderin
announced that a poet was about to recite. The poet,
a young negro, Christopher Culbert, read some of his
sonnets, in a liquid and at times almost shrill voice.
He had a round, dark-brown face, and a body verging
on chubbiness, and his verses were filled with
adored colors and a sentimentality that flirted with
morbidity for moments and then repented. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
effeminate and jovial in his manner, and after the
reading he returned to his place on a couch beside
another negro youth. Then another man, blackish
brown and with the body of an athlete, sang spirituals,
with a crazy, half-sobbing, swaying quaver in his
voice. A curious blending and contrast of elation and
austerity seemed to cling to him. As he intoned the
words of one song: &#8220;Ho-ow d&#8217;yuh kno-ow, ho-ow d&#8217;yuh
kno-o-ow, a-t the blo-od done si-ign mah na-a-me?&#8221;,
Blanche felt shivers racing up and down her spine.
These negroes certainly had something which white
people couldn&#8217;t possibly imitate&mdash;something that made
you feel wild, and sad, and swung you off your feet!
It was hard to put your finger on it&mdash;perhaps it was
a kind of insanity.</p>

<p>When the singer had finished, Vanderin announced
that Miss Bee Rollins, of the Down South night club
would do the Charleston dance. She stepped forward&mdash;a
palely creamish-brown skinned young negress with
a lissom body incongruously plump about the waist,
and an oval face, infinitely impertinent and infinitely
sensual in a loosely heavy way. She twisted and
bobbed and jerked through the maniacal obliquely
see-sawing and shuffling steps of the Charleston, with
a tense leer on her face, and inhumanly flexible legs.
She was madly applauded and forced to several encores.
Then the party broke up into dancing and more
steady drinking, with different negroes playing at the
piano, and the assistance of a phonograph in between.</p>

<p>The dancers undulated and embraced in a way that
surprised Blanche&mdash;even in the cheap dance halls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
which she had frequented, the floor-watchers always
immediately ordered off all couples who tried to get
away with such rough stuff. Well, anyway, it wasn&#8217;t
the main part of these people&#8217;s lives&mdash;their only thrill
and importance&mdash;as it was with the dance-hall men
and women. The couples in this studio were only
&#8220;cutting up&#8221; between their more serious, searching
labors and expressions, and they were certainly more
entitled to be frankly sexual, if they wanted to.</p>

<p>Blanche stepped over the floor with several negro
and white men, and enjoyed the novelty of dancing
as extremely as the other couples did, though she felt
the least bit guilty about it&mdash;it certainly was &#8220;going the
limit.&#8221; As she danced with the negroes she felt surprised
at her lack of aversion to the closeness of their
bodies. Somehow, they danced with a rhythmical, subtle,
audacious fervor which her white partners could
never quite duplicate, and she was swung into a happy
harmony with their movements in spite of herself.</p>

<p>As she was catching her breath between dances, she
watched some of the negroes around her. One of them,
a short, slender girl in a dark red smock and a short
black skirt, was conversing with a white youth in a
dark suit, who looked like a solemnly tipsy mingling
of clergyman and pagan. She had a pale brown skin,
black curls of bobbed hair, thin lips, and a pug nose.
She held his hand and gave him distrustfully tender
looks.</p>

<p>Blanche caught fragments of their conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t love me, hon.... You can get white girls
prettier than I am&mdash;I know....&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want them ... you&#8217;ve put a song in my
blood, right in it.... I&#8217;m crazy about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you mean it.... Lord knows, I&#8217;d like
so to believe you....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will, you will.... I&#8217;ll take care of that....&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her and then she withdrew, saying: &#8220;You
funny, funny, dear, impatient boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another young negress with a dark-brown skin and
a tall fullness to her body, was laughing violently beside
a thin, white man with a little black mustache and
a petulant face. She sang: &#8220;Mamma has her teeth all
filled with goldun bridges &#8217;n&#8217; diamon&#8217;s small, but
po-oor papa, po-o-or papa, got no teefies at a-all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not this papa,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ll prove it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew back, laughing, while he sought to embrace
her. They almost collided with a young negress
who was dancing with a middle-aged white man. She
was slim, with a straight-nosed, creamy face and
straight brown hair, while her partner was floridly
jowled and had the symptoms of a paunch, and sparse,
black hair. They stopped their dance and stood, talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen the Russian Players?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep, went down last night and took in that version
of Carmen&mdash;&#8216;Carmencita and the Soldier.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they a curious mixture of restraint and
hilarity? It&#8217;s a contradiction&mdash;a sort of disciplined
madness, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, they have dark, strange, patient souls,
and yet ... they can be wildness itself. And they&#8217;re
entirely obedient to the designs of the playwright.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
They never let their personalities swagger all over
the stage at the expense of the author.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two walked off, still talking, and Blanche eyed
them regretfully as she wished that they had remained
within hearing. Most of the men and women at the
party seemed to be disinclined to talk about impersonal
subjects. Their only aims were drinking, dancing, and
making love to each other. Of course, they were tired
of their more sober professions and the heavier problems
in life, and wanted to forget them for one night
at least&mdash;but this explanation scarcely lessened
Blanche&#8217;s disappointment. She was longing to hear
discussions on art and psychology&mdash;matters that were
still semishrouded to her. She had been to tens of
parties where people were &#8220;running wild&#8221; and foxtrotting
and mauling each other&mdash;it was nothing new
to her.</p>

<p>She answered the teasing remarks of the man beside
her with abstracted monosyllables, and watched another
couple&mdash;a tall, dark, negro youth, with the face
of a proud falcon, and an ample-bodied white woman
in her early thirties, with a round face void of cosmetics
but like an angelic mask that could not quite
hide the jaded sensuality underneath it. She leaned
closely against his side while he stroked one of her
arms and looked at her with an almost scornful longing
on his face. Blanche gazed intently at them&mdash;this
was an exception. All of the other mixed couples that
she had noticed had consisted of negro girls and white
men, and she had been on the verge of believing that
the women of her own race were only tolerantly &#8220;fooling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
around&#8221; and had no deep response to the colored
men. But no, she was wrong. Another white woman
and a negro youth were whispering together on the
piano-bench, with their heads almost touching and
their right hands clasping each other.</p>

<p>How queer it was&mdash;even she had succumbed to the
spell of the negroes, while dancing with them. They
were like wise children&mdash;they could be abandoned and
serious in such a quick succession, and there was an
assured, romping, graceful something about them.
Still, loving any one of them would probably be impossible&mdash;she
still shrank a little from the nearness
of their bodies, when the sorcery of the dances was
removed.</p>

<p>The teasing man departed, thinking her an odd iceberg,
and another man sat beside her. She turned
to look at him. He was of her own height and had a
muscular body, a pale white skin with the least tinge
of brown in it, and straight, light brown hair brushed
back. His lips were thin below a narrow nose, and his
large, gray eyes seemed to be full of silent laughter,
as though the scene were an endurable but trivial
comedy to him. In his tuxedo suit, well fitting and
distinctive, and with his athletic, graceful body, that
was neither too narrow nor too broad, and the high-chinned
but not supercilious poise of his head, he could
have been mistaken for some movie hero more natural
and finely chiseled than most of the other stars in that
profession.</p>

<p>He looked at Blanche and smiled&mdash;a smile that was
respectful but had the least touch of impudence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been introduced to you&mdash;I came in rather
late,&#8221; he said, easily. &#8220;My name&#8217;s Eric Starling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s Blanche Palmer,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it rather silly&mdash;this trading of names right
off the reel?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;They&#8217;re just empty sounds
until people get to know each other, and then, of
course, they do begin to suggest the qualities within
each person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s even more meaningless, if that&#8217;s possible,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t done a thing to make
it of any importance. Not a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re not gray-haired, yet&mdash;unless you dye
it,&#8221; he said, with a boyish geniality. &#8220;You have still
time enough to conquer the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had a soft and low, but unmistakably masculine
voice, that pleased her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a girl can keep on telling that to herself until
there&#8217;s no time left,&#8221; she responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;How doleful you sound,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Have a
heart&mdash;you&#8217;ll make me confess my own pessimism in
a minute, if you keep it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re still young&mdash;you have plenty of time
to conquer the wo-o-orld,&#8221; she said, mimickingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only trying to be pleasantly conventional,&#8221;
he responded. &#8220;Lord knows, I&#8217;m a child of night myself&mdash;morbid
moods, and hatreds, and despairs. I do
try to tone it down, though. The world may be a muddled
and treacherous place, on the whole, but if you
never laugh about it, then you let it interfere too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
much with your work. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m telling
you all this&mdash;you&#8217;re probably not interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>She liked his tone of quiet self-disparagement and
understanding resignation&mdash;the absence of the usual
masculine: &#8220;Look me over, kid, I&#8217;m there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m interested,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s this way&mdash;&#8217;f
you go around and laugh too much, why, then it&#8217;s
just like taking dope, and then again, &#8217;f you don&#8217;t
laugh enough, you see, you get too wise to your own
smallness. There&#8217;s never any cure for anything, I
guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up to this time he had regarded her only as a handsome
girl, a bit more unaffected and humorous than
the general run, but now he felt a much keener interest.
She had something to say&mdash;an intriguing oddity
among women. Who was this girl, with her dark red
hair in bobbed curls, and her jaunty, Irish-looking
face, and her words divided between whimsicality and
hopelessness? Perhaps she was a talented person,
well-known in her profession and amusing herself
with this posture of half-smiling and half darkly wistful
obscurity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re probably quite famous and rebuking me
for not having heard of you,&#8221; he said, after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Madame Jaurette would agree with
you,&#8221; she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother or dancing partner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She owns the Beauty Parlor where I work&mdash;I&#8217;m
just a common hair-dresser, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked closely at her&mdash;was she persistently jesting?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>&#8220;No fooling&mdash;come clean,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re not
really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know, I&#8217;m not like my type,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;I think a little, and I don&#8217;t use slang very often,
though I like it sometimes. Don&#8217;t be deceived so
easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;re trying to do something different,
anyway,&#8221; he said, convinced now that she was
telling the truth and engrossed in this phenomenon of
a seemingly intelligent and searching Beauty Shop girl.
&#8220;You could tell me you were a scrubwoman and I&#8217;d
still know instinctively that your job had nothing to
do with your ambitions. It&#8217;s in all your words and all
the expressions on your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt glad that his response had not been one
of veiled pity, or sexy flattery, or the polite ending of
interest, and her heart began to quicken its strokes.
Say, could he be the man that she had been looking
for? Could he? Silly, oh, very silly dream, and one
that could scarcely be changed to a proven reality by
a few beginning and possibly misleading words, and
yet ... she <i>was</i> attracted by his appearance&mdash;stalwart
and yet subdued, with no &#8220;fizz&#8221; about it&mdash;and
she liked immensely everything he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;My family&#8217;s poor and I&#8217;ve had to work to earn
my own living,&#8221; she said, simply. &#8220;I live in the toughest
part of Ninth Avenue&mdash;I was born and raised there.
The people I come from think that art&#8217;s the second
word in &#8216;Thou art bughouse.&#8217; Now you&#8217;ve got the
whole sad story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, seeing that confessions are in order, I&#8217;ll spill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
mine,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I was brought up in a neighborhood
where they throw paving-blocks at each other
to prove the sincerity of their feelings. One of them
hit me once, but it didn&#8217;t seem able to knock any
obedience into me. Oh, ye-es, nice, little neighborhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;F it&#8217;s any worse than Hell&#8217;s Kitchen it must be
a peach,&#8221; she replied, thoroughly unreserved and immersed
in him now.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is&mdash;Peoria Street in Chicago,&#8221; he said, smiling.
&#8220;If I could escape from Peoria Street, you&#8217;ll probably
be able to get out of Ninth Avenue with one wing-flutter
and a little audacity! I&#8217;m working for a Harlem
cabaret now&mdash;Tony&#8217;s Club. Publicity man ...
writing the blurbs, and arranging the banquets, and
getting the celebs to come down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure you&#8217;re different from most publicity
men, I can just feel it in your words and in the
looks on your face,&#8221; she answered, in a mocking voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady, I&#8217;ll never feed you that medicine again&mdash;the
taste is simply frightful,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>They both laughed and felt relieved about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know, I&#8217;ve got a writing bug buzzing in my
head,&#8221; she said, after a short pause. &#8220;It really started
only a night ago&mdash;I never dared to believe I could do
it before. I was down to Greenwich Village for the
first time, and when I came back I wrote a sketch of
the tearoom I&#8217;d been in. I didn&#8217;t think it amounted
to very much, but Max Oppendorf, the poet, you know,
he tells me it&#8217;s really clever and original, in spite of
the shaky grammar. I&#8217;m going to keep on writing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
you see, and he&#8217;s promised to criticize my stuff and try
to put it over for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I met Oppendorf once,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;He&#8217;s
tall and blond, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s him&mdash;he&#8217;s here to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t come with him, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No-o, don&#8217;t be scared,&#8221; she said, in raillery. &#8220;He&#8217;s
with a girl friend, Margaret Wheeler, and my, how
they&#8217;re gone on each other. It always seems to annoy
them when they&#8217;ve got to talk to somebody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;d you come with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With Ben Helgin, the novelist. I only met him and
Oppendorf last night, and I&#8217;m only a curiosity to him.
He just wanted to see how the slum-girlie would get
along in the mi-ighty studio. I hope he&#8217;s satisfied
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, people who patronize and bend down
all the time, do it as a hop-fiend sniffs his cocaine,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;They might have to take a close peek at
themselves otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the truth,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;When I think
of all the dopes people use to kid themselves along, I
get the Jailhouse Blues. I was just as bad myself, two
or three years ago, before I commenced to get wise
to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pause came, during which they looked at each
other with a budding and almost incredulous desire.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, I have another confession to make,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Close your eyes and take the blow. I&#8217;m one
of those dreamy, high-handed, impossible poets you&#8217;ve
heard about. Vanderin likes my stuff and he&#8217;s induced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Koller, the publisher, to take a first book of mine.
I grind it out between the times when I&#8217;m slaving down
at Tony&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three cheers,&#8221; she answered, delightedly. &#8220;Perhaps
we can put our heads together now, and maybe
you&#8217;ll help me with my work. I know you must have
much more education than I&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I did work my way through two years of college,
but I stopped after that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was too
dry, and heavy, and, well, conservative, to satisfy me.
A million don&#8217;ts and rules and rules and boundaries.
They&#8217;re all right to know but they&#8217;re not so sacred
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I envy you, anyway,&#8221; she replied, sighing.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to help me with my grammar&mdash;that&#8217;s the
big, weak sister with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can bet I will,&#8221; he responded, eagerly.</p>

<p>She was certainly an unusual girl&mdash;one who had
somehow commenced to force her way out of a vicious,
muddy environment. Since he had partially freed himself
from the same thing, it was a sacred duty to help
her. But he wouldn&#8217;t do it for that reason alone&mdash;he
liked the jolly and yet pensive turn of her, and the
undismayed and candid twist of her mind, and the soft
irregularities of her face, which were charming in spite
of their lack of a perfect prettiness, and the boldly
curved but not indelicate proportions of her strong
body. Of course, it was nonsense to believe that you
could fall in love after several minutes of talking, and
there was Lucia, the clever little hoyden whom he had
gone with for two years now, and Clara, savage, beautiful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
and dumb, and Georgie, keen-minded enough but
a little hysterical at times, and promiscuous, and....
But after all, none of them except Lucia had ever
aroused him to any depth of emotion, and even that
had long since begun to wear off. She was mentally
shallow&mdash;women usually turned out to be that, after
you penetrated their little tricks and defenses. Would
this girl prove to be of the same kind? Maybe, maybe,
but there was one thing about her that he hadn&#8217;t
found in any other women&mdash;the instant, frank, ingenuous
way in which she had intimately revealed
herself, without all of the wrigglings and parryings
common to her sex. They sure did hate to get down to
brass tacks.</p>

<p>He was an odd confusion of sentimentalities and
cynicisms, and the conflict between them was often an
indecisive one. As he looked at Blanche, a fear suddenly
shot through him.... Lord, he had forgotten.
The old, dirty scarecrow that would probably turn
her away from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know, I was certainly surprised when I came
here to-night,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I never imagined that
negroes and white people&mdash;real, artistic ones, I mean&mdash;I
never imagined that they went around with each
other and made love together. I don&#8217;t know just how
to take it. How would you feel if you met a good-looking,
intelligent, negro girl and she became fond
of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He winced and his face tightened up. It was just
as he had feared&mdash;she had mistaken him for a white
man. Of course, he <i>was</i> white for the most part ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
just a fraction of negro blood, but he was proud of it
just the same, damn proud of it, and if people wanted
to repulse him because of this fraction, they could
go straight to the devil for all he cared.... Should
he tell her now and have it over with? He hesitated.
Despite his impatient pride he could not bring the
words to his lips, as he had done many times before
in such cases. White women often made this mistake,
and he was inured to correcting it and bearing their
constraint, or their shifting to a careful cordiality,
but this time his self-possession had vanished. Sometimes
he <i>had</i> failed to tell women, when he had only
wanted a night or two of physical enjoyment with
them, for then it never mattered, but ... some miracle
had happened. This girl really seemed to have cut
beneath his skin, and ... yes, he was afraid of losing
the chance to see her again.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t love her now&mdash;in the deep, seething way
that was the real thing&mdash;but he felt that if he continued
to meet her he probably would, and this was a
rare sensation to him. She would have to be told
some time, of course, but ... not to-night. He simply
couldn&#8217;t run the risk of spoiling this growing harmony
between them, of not seeing whether it might
flower out into an actual ecstasy. He couldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Blanche began to wonder at his lengthy silence, and
she looked inquiringly at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please excuse me,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I was sort
of ... sort of waltzing in a dream with you for a
while.... Negroes and whites are human beings after
all, and the fact that a man&#8217;s colored shouldn&#8217;t make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
him an inferior animal. But that&#8217;s an old story to me.
I&#8217;ve got it all memorized. Race-prejudice, and fun-da-men-tal
repugnance, and all the disasters that spring
from intermingling. Oh, yes, these things exist in
most people, of course they do, but I refuse to believe
that exceptional men and women can&#8217;t rise above
them. If they can&#8217;t, then what <i>is</i> exceptional about
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in the weary contempt of his words
should have suggested to her that he was pleading his
own cause, but her delighted immersion in him made
her oblivious, and she mistook his words for those
of a rarely unprejudiced white man. How eloquently
and clearly he talked! He had an unassuming but
fervent way that was far more attractive than Helgin&#8217;s
suave, superior jovialities, or Oppendorf&#8217;s tired
belligerency, or any of the other postures which she
had noticed in different men at the party. Was she
really beginning to fall in love with this Eric Starling?
Somehow, she felt that no matter what faults she might
discover in him afterwards, they would not be huge
enough to destroy this present sense of communion
with him. You had to trust to your instinct in such
matters, and this instinct certainly hadn&#8217;t failed her
up to date. Hadn&#8217;t she always doubted and feared
Campbell, and held him at arm&#8217;s length, in spite of
his smooth protests and promises? But gee, what if
she <i>were</i> deceiving herself? This time it would be a
real blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I agree with you.... I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; she
answered at last. &#8220;I guess no person can tell how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
he&#8217;s going to feel about, well, loving somebody who&#8217;s
of another race, unless he actually runs up against it
himself. I certainly believe negroes and whites ought
to talk together, though, and try to understand each
other more. There&#8217;s too much darn hate and meanness
in this little world, as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, entirely too much,&#8221; he said, in an abstractedly
weary way.</p>

<p>Helgin walked up and Blanche introduced him to
Starling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Found your ideal yet, little gal?&#8221; he asked, grinning.
&#8220;A studio-party&#8217;s an excellent place for such
delusions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;F I had, I wouldn&#8217;t tell you, old boy,&#8221; she answered
impertinently. &#8220;You&#8217;d just answer &#8216;Nice li&#8217;l
baby, all blind and deaf and everything.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ideals are out of fashion, Mr. Helgin,&#8221; Starling
said. &#8220;They don&#8217;t seem to blend so well with synthetic
gin, and the Charleston, and divorces at six for a
dollar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helgin countered with one of his bland ironies and
then said: &#8220;The party&#8217;s beginning to break up, now.
Are you ready to leave, Miss Palmer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind if I saw Miss Palmer home?&#8221;
Starling asked, bluntly, but in a soft voice. &#8220;I hope
you won&#8217;t be irritated at my nerve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helgin laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not, if it&#8217;s agreeable to her,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I never have any desire to interfere with blossoming
romances.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>&#8220;You won&#8217;t think I&#8217;m being terribly rude, will you?&#8221;
Blanche asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go o-on, stop the nervous apologies, child,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really glad that you&#8217;ve found a kindred
soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook hands with the other two and walked
away.</p>

<p>As Blanche and Starling went for their wraps, they
ran into Oppendorf and Margaret, and Blanche introduced
the two men, who vaguely remembered that they
had met somewhere before. Oppendorf looked even
sleepier and more distant than usual, while Margaret
was in a giggling daze of contentment.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t kiss more than two other girls to-night,&#8221;
she said gayly. &#8220;I really think he must be beginning
to care for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t count more than two in your case, but
then we had our backs turned once in a while,&#8221; Oppendorf
replied.</p>

<p>Blanche promised to visit Margaret&#8217;s studio at the
end of the week, with another manuscript for Oppendorf&#8217;s
appraisal, and the two couples separated.</p>

<p>During the taxicab ride to her home, Starling held
her hand, but made no effort to embrace her, and although
she wanted him to, she felt rather glad at his
reserve. How tired she had become of men who desperately
tried to rush her at the end of the first night.
It almost seemed as though rarely desirable men
were never instantly frantic about it&mdash;as though their
unabashed quietness alone proved their rarity. Naturally,
only starved or oversexed men were so immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
anxious for physical intimacies, although ...
Starling might have kissed her at least.</p>

<p>As Blanche stood in the dirty, poorly lit hallway,
she smiled for a moment as she remembered how often
she had been in this same spot, permitting men to kiss
and hug her, out of pity or as a small payment for the
&#8220;good time&#8221; that they had shown her. And now she
was parting with a man infinitely more cajoling than
they had been, and merely clasping hands with him.
Life was certainly &#8220;cuckoo&#8221; all right. She had arranged
to see Starling at the end of the week and leave
a night of rest in between. As she retired to her bed,
the satiated remnants of the ecstasy-herald were shifting
slowly, slowly in her breast. The dream had finally
peered around the corner ... how nice, how sweet, how
terrifying....</p>

<p>On the following day, as she worked at the Beauty
Parlor, she was in a sulkily grimacing mood. Oh, this
endless ha-air-curling, and face-massaging ... beautifying
women and girls so that some male fool would
spend his money on them, or offer to marry them, or
try to caress them. Gold-diggers, and loose women
too passionate to be very efficient gold-diggers, and
lazy, decent housewives, and sly-faced wives with a
man or two on the side, and kiss-me-&#8217;n&#8217;-fade-away
flappers&mdash;take away their bodies and what would be
left of them? Less than a grease-spot. Drat this
empty, tiresome work. She&#8217;d have to get out of it
pretty soon or go loony. She wanted to write, and
describe people, and live in a decent place, and ...
see Eric Starling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>He moved about in her mind; his fingers were still
touching her hands. What a strong body and well-shaped
face he had. Funny about men&#8217;s faces ...
they were usually either too weakly perfect&mdash;movie-hero-like&mdash;or
too homely, but Starling&#8217;s was in between.
And he had a curious quality&mdash;not humble but
sort of sadly and smilingly erect. What was it, anyway?</p>

<p>During the next two days she treated her family with
a greater degree of merry friendliness, and they began
faintly to hope that she was coming around to
their ways of thinking. In reality, they had ceased to
matter much to her, all except her mother, for whom
she still felt a weak and troubled compassion. Poor,
hard-working, patient, stupid ma. But what on earth
could be done to help her?</p>

<p>Propped up against the pillows on her bed, Blanche
had written an account of the Vanderin party. With
more confident emotions now, fortified by Oppendorf&#8217;s
praise, and with a little, dizzy ache in her head, her
fingers had passed less laboriously over the paper.
Her sketch was pointedly humorous and disrespectful,
and stuck its tongue out at the different men and
women who had attended the party. They might be
celebrities and all that, but most of them hadn&#8217;t acted
and talked much different from the business men and
chorines whom she had met at other affairs. She enjoyed
the task of good-naturedly attacking them&mdash;it
was like revenging her own undeserved obscurity.</p>

<p>Her sketch was full of lines such as: &#8220;She was fat,
and when she did the Charleston with a little skinny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
fellow, why he looked just like a frightened kid,&#8221; and
&#8220;The negroes and whites, all except the loving couples,
they acted like they were trying too hard to be happy
together,&#8221; and &#8220;The party was a good excuse for
necking, but they all could have done it much better
alone,&#8221; and &#8220;They introduced him as a poet, but when
he started to talk to you, why then you got more uncertain
about it, and when he was through talking you
were just sure that something must be wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she met Starling, on Saturday night, she was
in a facetious and tiptoeing mood. Hot doggie, life
was perking up again. As they rode in a taxicab down
to Margaret&#8217;s studio, she showed him the sketch, and
he laughed loudly over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, the trouble between colored and white
people at parties is that they&#8217;re both acting up to each
other,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The whites are doing their darnedest
to be tolerant and, well, cordial, and the colored
people are always a little uncomfortable. They act
self-conscious, you know, or too wild, and why?
They&#8217;re all trying to put their best foot forward, and
show that they belong there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how about all the loving pairs I saw at Vanderin&#8217;s?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;They sure didn&#8217;t seem to mind
it much.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed and closed his eyes for a moment. Of
course, she didn&#8217;t know that in eight cases out of ten&mdash;perhaps
more&mdash;these pairs had nothing but a passing
lust for each other. And what if they did?&mdash;that part
of it was all right. There was no earthly reason why
they shouldn&#8217;t want each other&#8217;s bodies, unless they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
were too cruel or sneering about it. God, sex could be
a wild, clean, naked, beautiful thing, and people were
always hurling mud and denunciations at it, or slinking
with it behind closed doors, damn them. But he
didn&#8217;t want just a flitting affair with Blanche ... he
was sure of that now. He had been afraid that the
encouragement of night, and the highballs, and the
party, might have caused him to throw a false radiance
around this girl&mdash;he had done the same thing before,
though never so severely. But now he realized that
his feelings for her were made of more solid stuff&mdash;realized
it just after he had finished reading her sketch.
He liked her upstanding, inquiring, impertinent spirit,
and the unaffected smiles and <i>mou&eacute;s</i> that appeared
on her face, and the sturdy and yet soft freshness of
her body.</p>

<p>Hell was probably facing him. He was a negro, yes,
and proud of it, but suppose it caused him to lose
this woman? He would almost hate it, then&mdash;this
streak of black blood which he had always flaunted
so defiantly. He wasn&#8217;t like other men of his kind&mdash;cringing
about it, and claiming to be entirely white,
and fawning before every white woman they met.
Stupid lily-snatchers! Not he! Yet he was sorely
tempted to flee to this lie, in Blanche&#8217;s case. If he confessed,
then all of his hopes and longings might be shot
to pieces. He could picture her in his mind, recoiling
from him against her will, summoning pleasant and
compassionate smiles, trying to soothe the wound
caused by her sorrowful determination never to see him
again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>Puzzled by his frowning silence, she said: &#8220;What&#8217;s
the matter, Eric?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was just brooding over some of the injustice
in this world,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;It&#8217;s absurd, of course&mdash;never
does any good. What were we talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said something about negroes and whites always
acting up to each other,&#8221; Blanche answered, &#8220;and
then I said that some of the couples I saw at Vanderin&#8217;s
seemed to be really gone on each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they are&mdash;for a night, or a month. A
year&#8217;s the world&#8217;s record as far&#8217;s I know. It&#8217;s nothing
but surface sex-appeal, you know, and it&#8217;s not much
different from the old plantation-owners down South,
who used to pick out colored mistresses. The only difference
nowadays is that white women are starting to
respond to colored men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, I wonder &#8217;f I could care for you, &#8217;f you were
colored ... I wonder now,&#8221; Blanche said, reflectively.
&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll never have to bother about it,
but it&#8217;s interesting just the same. I guess a woman
never knows how she&#8217;ll feel about anything until she&#8217;s
got to make a choice. It&#8217;s all right to think it over and
say &#8216;I could&#8217; &#8217;r &#8216;I couldn&#8217;t,&#8217; but that&#8217;s just because
you&#8217;ve got to pretend to know yourself anyway. It
kind of keeps up your backbone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not notice the pain that twisted his face.
He tried his best to be humorous ... this dark bugaboo
was getting on his nerves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mix black and white together and they make gray,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I never did like that color. Let&#8217;s be more
gaudy to-night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re a terrible liar&mdash;you&#8217;re wearing a gray
suit,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s a man to do?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You women
can put on lavender, and orange, and cerise clothes,
but if a man tried it he&#8217;d be howled out of town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all your own fault,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Men just hate
to look different from each other, and besides, they&#8217;re
always afraid that somebody&#8217;s going to think that
they&#8217;re showing some weakness or other. I know
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they continued the conversation, in a vein of
mock-chiding and sprightly rebuke, she knew that
she was rapidly descending into the depths of a love
for him. She had also been afraid that the giddiness
of night and a party, plus her own thwarted longings,
might have induced her to throw a glamor over him,
and that her next meeting with him might turn out to
be somewhat disillusioning. But no, his mixture of
frowns and deft gayeties, and his clear, incisive way of
talking, were causing her emotions to increase in leaps
and bounds. Whenever his shoulder grazed hers, a
shamefaced tremor was born within her.</p>

<p>After they had reached Margaret&#8217;s studio they became
more spontaneously mirthful. Margaret was in
a frothy mood and Oppendorf seemed to be more affable
and relaxed than usual. He read Blanche&#8217;s sketch
with a broad grin on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff, rip it into them, old girl,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;When they&#8217;re not strapping their pedestals to their
backs and setting them up in this place and that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
they&#8217;re wildly reaching for each other&#8217;s flesh. The
very thought of an unassuming naturalness, or a frank
and good-natured exchange of challenges, would give
them heart failure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry&mdash;they&#8217;ll live,&#8221; Starling replied.</p>

<p>Oppendorf was aware of the fact that Starling was
a negro, and Starling liked the blunt and impersonal
way in which the other man treated him. Congenial,
and tossing epigrammatic jests about, the party wended
its way to Tony&#8217;s Club and danced there until 3
<span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> The cabaret was a wild, gargoylish, shamelessly
tawdry place, trimmed with colored strings of confetti,
and orange and black boxes over the electric lights
hanging from its low, basement-ceiling, and atrocious
wall-panels of half nude women in Grecian draperies,
and booths against the walls, each booth bearing the
name of a different state. A brightly painted railing
hemmed in the rectangular dance floor, and the jazz-orchestra&mdash;one
of the best in town&mdash;moaned and
screeched and thudded, in the manner of some super-rou&eacute;,
chortling as he rolled his huge dice to see who
his next mistress would be.</p>

<p>Margaret, who also knew that Starling was a negro,
glanced curiously at Blanche now and then, and wondered
whether Blanche also knew and whether she had
found that it raised no barrier. The subject, however,
was too delicate to be broached to Blanche on this
night.... It would have to wait.</p>

<p>Since she was with a man whom she practically
loved, Blanche&#8217;s usual wariness toward alcohol&mdash;a caution
produced by her desire not to become an unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
prey&mdash;left her entirely, and in spite of Starling&#8217;s
remonstrances, she drank with a reckless glee. When
3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the closing time, arrived, she was giggling
fondly at him, and trying to balance glasses on her
nose, and snuggling her head against his shoulder.</p>

<p>When the party reached the street she was barely
able to walk, and had to lean against Starling for support.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you two come down to our place?&#8221;
Margaret asked. &#8220;The poor kid&#8217;s going to pass out
soon, and then you&#8217;ll be in a devil of a fix unless she&#8217;s
safely inside somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll call a cab and take her home,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Thank you just the same. She comes from a stupid
family, you know, and they&#8217;d probably raise a vicious
row if she came back to-morrow afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>After bidding the other two farewell, Starling hailed
a cab and gave Blanche&#8217;s address to the driver. She
passed out completely in the cab, with her arm around
his shoulder and her head on his breast, and as he
thought it over he began to regret his decision. He
would be forced to carry her to the door of her apartment
and wake up her family, and since they were
obtuse proletarians, they might imagine that he had
plied her with liquor to achieve her seduction. In that
case there would be a sweet rumpus, all right! He was
not afraid of a possible fight&mdash;swinging fists was nothing
new to him&mdash;but if one did occur, her folks would
probably order her never to see him again, or would
look him up and discover his negro blood. Again, the
ever-blundering &#8220;cops&#8221; might also interfere in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
matter.... In this world it was often imperative to
avoid the sordid misinterpretations of other people,
for otherwise you would simply be expending your
energy to no purpose. No, the best thing would be to
take Blanche to his apartment and let her sleep it
off, for then she could return home with the usual
story of having &#8220;stayed over&#8221; at some girl-friend&#8217;s
home. Fearful lies, lies, lies&mdash;sometimes he thought
that the entire world was just a swamp of them. Well,
hell, you&#8217;d get very far, wouldn&#8217;t you, trying to hold
out against it!</p>

<p>He tapped on the pane and told the driver to switch
to a Harlem address. After he had paid the driver
and was half carrying Blanche over the sidewalk, the
man called after him: &#8220;That&#8217;s the way to get &#8217;em, Bo!&#8221;
Starling turned and was about to leap at the leering
chauffeur, but burdened with Blanche, whom he could
scarcely deposit on the walk, and fearing to arouse
the neighbors in his building, he ignored the remark.</p>

<p>His apartment consisted of two rooms and a kitchenette,
and after he had placed Blanche on a couch
in one of the rooms, he closed the door and changed
to his slippers and a dressing-gown. Then he sat down
in an armchair and grinned, in a sneer at himself,
as he lit a cigarette. This was exactly like one of the
impossible climaxes in a cheap movie-reel. The handsome
hero had the proudly beautiful girl at his mercy,
but nobly and honorably refused to compromise her.
Oh, rats, why not walk in and take the only crude,
gone-to-morrow happiness that life seemed to offer.
Otherwise, she would find out about his negro blood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
before their achievement of finality, and depart from
him or tell him to be &#8220;just a dear friend,&#8221; and what
would he have then?&mdash;not even the remembrance of
a compensating night. Hell, he ought to regard her as
just another blood-stirring girl, and ravish her, and
forget her afterwards. If you failed to trick and abuse
women, they usually sought to turn the cards on you&mdash;he&#8217;d
found that out often enough.</p>

<p>He arose and paced up and down the room. No, he
was a mawkish fool, a sentimental jackass&mdash;he
couldn&#8217;t do it. The dirty nigger couldn&#8217;t leap on the
superior white girl, damn it. He loved this girl&mdash;no
doubt about that. She had a clear, honest, stumbling-on
mind, and her heart was free from pretenses and
hidden schemes, and a unique essence, tenderly simple
and defiant by turns, seemed to saturate her. It wasn&#8217;t
just her body and face&mdash;he had known prettier girls
by far&mdash;but it was something that clung to this body
and face and transformed them to an inexplicable but
indubitable preciousness. She was unconscious now,
and her inert surrender would mean nothing to him
except a cheap and empty triumph. He wanted her to
come to him joyously, spontaneously, madly, and with
quiverings and shinings on her face!</p>

<p>He sat down again in the armchair. Damn his luck,
why couldn&#8217;t he have fallen in love with another negro
girl? He wasn&#8217;t like some of the men of his race&mdash;always
chasing after white girls because it gave these
men a thrill to boast of having captured them, and
soothed their miserable inferiority complex. He had
nearly always stuck to the girls of his own race, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
yes, he had loved two of them ... in a way ... but
it hadn&#8217;t been the surging, frightened, and at times
abashed thing that he was feeling now. He was in for
it now, oh, how he was in for it! He would undoubtedly
be rejected, and pitied, and reduced to every
kind of helpless writhing. It was in him to curse the
very day on which he had entered the earth.... Good
God, why couldn&#8217;t he shake off this morbid hopelessness?
How did he know what would happen, after all?
Perhaps her love for him was as overwhelming as his.
Perhaps she would be forced to cling to him, in spite
of every enormous warning and obstacle.</p>

<p>He passed into a fitful and often dream-groaning
sleep. When he awoke it was noon. His room seemed
uglier than usual&mdash;the straight, oak furniture, and
the worn, brown carpet, and the rose-stamped wallpaper
were like slaps against his spirit. Money, money&mdash;the
devil sure had been in an ingenious mood when
he invented it.... And Blanche Palmer was in the
next room&mdash;all of him tingled incredibly at the thought
of her proximity, and his heavy head grew a bit
lighter. Then the door opened and she walked out,
slowly, with a sulky, half sleepy, questioning look on
her face, and rumpled hair, and a wrinkled gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eric, what&#8217;m I doing here&mdash;what happened last
night?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, dear, and let your head clear a bit&mdash;I&#8217;ll
tell you,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>She dropped into the armchair and he drew another
chair beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You passed out in the cab after we left Tony&#8217;s,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
and I decided to bring you here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would
have been rather ticklish, carrying you in my arms
and waking up your, u-um, intellectual family. Their
response might have been just a trifle excited, you
know. You&#8217;re not angry with me, are you, Blanche?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked steadily at him, with her head too confused
and aching for any definite emotion&mdash;for the
moment&mdash;and then, very slowly, she gave him a tenderly
rebuking smile. Somehow, she knew that he
had left her in peace while she had slept at his place,
and funny, this time she would not have minded an
opposite gesture. Things never seemed to intrude
upon you unless you were seeking to avoid them! Yet,
she was touched by this proof that he had not been
hiding a mere, ordinary lust for her. Sweet, sweet boy
... how her head swayed and throbbed, and yet, despite
the pain, a happiness tried to lessen it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You really shouldn&#8217;t have brought me here,&#8221; she
said at last. &#8220;My folks&#8217;ll raise the dickens with me
now. Their system is wink your eye at daughter &#8217;f
she gets back any time before 6 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, and call her
a bad woman &#8217;f she doesn&#8217;t. Still, you&#8217;d have been in
for it &#8217;f you <i>had</i> brought me back, I guess. There
wasn&#8217;t much choice in the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you leave that dirty den of yours?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;You can&#8217;t go on sacrificing yourself forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to leave pretty soon,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;I&#8217;d have done it long ago, only I didn&#8217;t see much difference
between living home and staying in some
spotty hall-bedroom, and I&#8217;ve never had money enough
for more than that. Maybe I can get a fairly decent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
place in the Village, though. Margaret tells me that
rents are much cheaper down there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;d better look around,&#8221; he said, dully.</p>

<p>He couldn&#8217;t ask her to live with him, or to marry
him&mdash;especially the latter&mdash;without telling the secret
to her, and once more his courage failed him. While
she was bathing and making her toilette, he fixed a
simple breakfast in the kitchenette. Afterwards, as
they were lolling over the coffee, he said: &#8220;You&#8217;re
looking beautiful this morning. Your face is like ...
well, like a wild rose and a breeze flirting with each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only too willing to believe you, Eric,&#8221; she answered,
softly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t make me conceited now.&#8221;</p>

<p>An irresistible impulse came to him. He arose,
walked around the table, and bent down to her. She
curved her arms about his shoulders, and they traded
a lengthy kiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in love with you, Blanche,&#8221; he said, looking
away, after he had straightened up.</p>

<p>She grasped one of his hands and answered: &#8220;Why,
you&#8217;re startling me, Eric&mdash;I&#8217;d never have guessed it.
Would it surprise, you, too, &#8217;f I said I loved you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say it and find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent down and kissed her again. Then he
clenched one of his fists and walked away. It would
have to be told now ... or never.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s sit on the couch, Blanche, I want to talk to
you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>After she had acquiesced they were silent for a full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
minute, while she looked at him and wondered at his
nervous remoteness. Then he turned to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m a negro,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>She stared at him with an unbelieving frown on
her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;A ... what?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man of negro blood. My grandfather was white
and he married a negress, and my mother married
another white man. That&#8217;s the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she stared at him she felt too stunned for any
single emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eric, you&#8217;re fooling me, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; she asked at
last, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But ... but, Eric, you look exactly like a white
man! It can&#8217;t be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, just the same,&#8221; he answered, oddly relieved,
now that he had blurted the thing out, and stoically
waiting for her words to strike him. &#8220;I have just a
small fraction of negro blood, as you see, and most
people, like you, mistake me for a white man. God,
how I wish I were coal-black&mdash;it would have saved
me from the heartache that&#8217;s coming to me now!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked away from him for a while, with a veritable
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> of fear, brave indifference to the revelation,
and self-doubt contending within her. Eric Starling
was a negro, and she had fallen in love with him,
and ... would she be averse to touching him, now?
Would it make any difference? She reached for his
hand and held it tightly for a moment, almost in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
absurd effort to discover the answer to the question.
Oh, what were words, anyway? He could tell her that
he was negro until he became blue in the face, but
he didn&#8217;t give her the feeling of one. Somehow, he
just didn&#8217;t have the physical essence which she had
always felt in the presence of other negroes, even
those at the Vanderin party. He just didn&#8217;t have it.
There was a fresh, lovely sturdiness attached to his
body, and she wanted to be in his arms, and she
couldn&#8217;t help herself. She loved him with every last
blood-drop in her heart.</p>

<p>But the future, with all its ghastly dangers and
troubles. If she married him, or if they lived together,
her father and brothers would try to kill him, or injure
him&mdash;she knew what <i>they</i> would do well enough, the
stupid roughnecks&mdash;and her mother would weep and
shriek, and perhaps try to kill herself, and other people
would shun them, or make trouble for them. Even
the dirty newspapers might take it up&mdash;hadn&#8217;t she read
last week about a negro who had been hounded out
of a New Jersey town because he loved a white girl
and they wanted to marry each other? People were
always like wolves, waiting to leap upon you if you
dared to disregard any of their cherished &#8220;Thou Shalt
Nots&#8221; ... just like wolves. The whole world seemed to
be in a conspiracy to prevent people from becoming
natural beings and doing as they pleased, even when
their acts couldn&#8217;t possibly injure anybody. It was
terrible.</p>

<p>And she herself, would she have courage enough
to defy everything for his sake, and would her love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
for him continue in spite of all the threats and intrusions?
She turned to look at him again. He was
slumping down on the couch, with his hands resting
limply on his outstretched legs, and his head lowered.
All of her heart bounded toward him, and she flung
herself against him and cried: &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you
are, Eric! I love you and I&#8217;m going to stick to you.
I love you, Eric, dear one.&#8221;</p>

<p>With hosannas in his heart, he placed his arms
around her, and they passed into an incoherence of
weeping, and kissing, and whispered endearments, and
sighs, and strainings. A full hour passed in this way
before they could slowly return to some semblance of
composure. Then, gradually, they tried to discuss the
predicament facing them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure that you love me now, dear, but you&#8217;ve
got to be doubly sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We won&#8217;t see each
other for the next two weeks, and we&#8217;ll have a chance
to think things over then. It&#8217;ll be hard, hard, but we&#8217;ve
simply got to do it. Our minds will work better when
we&#8217;re alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re right, Eric,&#8221; she said, slowly, &#8220;but
it wouldn&#8217;t change me any &#8217;f I didn&#8217;t see you for a
year, &#8217;r a lifetime. Don&#8217;t be afraid of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think so now, and, God, I hope it&#8217;s true, but
you must realize what we&#8217;re going to be up against,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;Your family will raise hell, of course,
and other people will turn their backs on us, and you&#8217;ll
have to mingle with negro friends of mine and live
among them.... Are you sure you&#8217;ll be able to face
all these things?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>She hid her head on the couch for a while, and then
raised it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be honest with you, Eric,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll love
you for the rest of my life, and I&#8217;ll never have anything
to do with any other man, but I don&#8217;t know
whether I&#8217;m brave enough to marry you and ... and
take all the blows you&#8217;ve been talking about. I just
don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were less selfish I&#8217;d give you up for your
own good,&#8221; he answered, moodily.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about myself?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
know I&#8217;m afraid that my father and my brothers will
try to hurt you, &#8217;r even kill you? Why, I can see the
anger and the meanness on their faces right now, and
it won&#8217;t do any good to talk to them! &#8217;F I were less
selfish, I&#8217;d want to give <i>you</i> up, just to save you,
Eric.&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her again, and they murmured promises
and were loath to withdraw from each other. Finally,
she rose from the couch and tried to bring a brave
smile to her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve simply got to be going now, Eric,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll come up here the Saturday after next, two weeks
from now, dear, &#8217;r I&#8217;ll write you &#8217;f I just must see you
sooner.... I know I <i>will</i> marry you, Eric, in spite
of everything&mdash;I know I will&mdash;but it&#8217;ll be better for
both of us &#8217;f we take our time about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s true,&#8221; he answered, as he fondled her
cheek. &#8220;I&#8217;ll spend most of the two weeks writing
poems to you, when I&#8217;m not in harness down at Tony&#8217;s.
It&#8217;ll be some consolation, anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>She donned her hat, and they exchanged several
&#8220;last&#8221; hugs before they descended to the street, where
he called a cab for her and, in spite of her protestations,
slipped a bill into the driver&#8217;s hands. When she
reached her home, the family were seated in the
kitchen, smoking, reading the Sunday papers, and
occasionally debating on the subject of her whereabouts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, give &#8217;n account of y&#8217;rself, come on,&#8221; her
father said, gruffly, as she removed her hat and desperately
tried to straighten out the wrinkles in her
dress. &#8220;&#8217;F you was out with Campbell again, I&#8217;ll make
him talk turkey this time. He can&#8217;t fool around with
one of my girls and not expect to do the right thing
by her.&#8221;</p>

<p>His little eyes were tense with irritation and suspicion
as he watched her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, you&#8217;ve got a nerve, all right,&#8221; Mabel piped
up. &#8220;<i>I</i> never come trotting in at three in the afternoon!
You&#8217;re just losing all respect for yourself, that&#8217;s what.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, listen, I&#8217;m not a child, any more,&#8221; Blanche
answered, wearily resuming the old, useless blah-blahing.
&#8220;I went to a party down in the Village and stayed
overnight at my girl-friend&#8217;s studio, Margaret Wheeler,
but I don&#8217;t see why I have to make any excuses about
it. If the rest of you don&#8217;t like the way I act, I&#8217;ll pack
up my things and leave, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will, huh?&#8221; her father asked. &#8220;Well, maybe
we&#8217;ll tell you ourselves to clear outa here. &#8217;F you can&#8217;t
show any respect for your folks, then it&#8217;s high time
somethin&#8217; was done about it!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>&#8220;Yeh, that goes for me, too,&#8221; Harry said.</p>

<p>He suspected that his sister had rejoined Campbell,
and he determined to look Joe up and frighten him into
marrying her. The damn fool&mdash;she didn&#8217;t have sense
enough to look out for herself, and if she kept it up,
she&#8217;d wind up by becoming little better than the easy
skirts he knocked around with. He wouldn&#8217;t let that
happen to <i>his</i> sister&mdash;not he.</p>

<p>Kate Palmer stuck to her invariable r&ocirc;le of peacemaker,
though she felt sick at heart at her daughter&#8217;s
silliness and looseness. She was staying out overnight
with men and getting to be a regular bad woman. It
was really terrible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, we won&#8217;t let you leave home,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;but you&#8217;re actin&#8217; sim-ply awful nowadays. You&#8217;ll be
disgracin&#8217; all of us the next thing we know, gettin&#8217;
into some trouble &#8217;r somethin&#8217;. Won&#8217;t you promise
your ma not to stay out all night? Won&#8217;t you, Blanie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I don&#8217;t want to hurt you, ma,&#8221; Blanche
replied, as she stroked her mother&#8217;s hair, &#8220;but just the
same, I&#8217;ve got to lead my own life from now on. I&#8217;m
a grown-up person, ma, and not a slave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know we&#8217;re just askin&#8217; you to act decint-like,
you know it,&#8221; her mother said, sadly. &#8220;We&#8217;re none
of us tryin&#8217; to hold you down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, that&#8217;s right, you&#8217;re getting too bold,&#8221; Mabel
cut in, with disguised envy.</p>

<p><i>She</i> scarcely ever &#8220;went the limit&#8221; with men, and
why should her sister be privileged to be more brazen
about it.</p>

<p>During all of these tirades, Blanche had wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
at her own indifference&mdash;the battle was on again, but
now it had only a comical aspect. These pent-up,
dense, jealous people&mdash;could they really be related
to her own flesh and blood? They seemed to be so
remote and impossible. None of them, except her
mother, stirred her in the least, and even there it was
only a mild compassion. Yet, once she had loved them
in a fashion, and felt some degree of a warm nearness
that even wrangling had never quite been able
to remove. What marvels happened to you, once your
mind began to expand. That was it&mdash;their minds were
still and hard, and little more than the talking slaves
of their emotions&mdash;while hers was restless and separate,
and had slowly overcome the blindness of her
former emotions toward them.</p>

<p>And now ... ah, if they had only known what they
really had to rave about. How they would have
pounced upon her! The sick fear returned to her as
she reclined upon the bed in her room. Perhaps it
might be wiser to pack up and leave home immediately.
Yet, that would only be a breathing spell. If
she married Starling, or lived with him, they would
inevitably investigate and discover his negro blood,
and the storm would burst, anyway. She tossed about
in a brooding indecision.</p>

<p>During the next week she surprised her family by
remaining in her room each night. What had come
over her?&mdash;she must be sick, or in some secret difficulty.
When a girl moped around and didn&#8217;t care
to enjoy herself at night, something must be wrong,
especially a girl like Blanche, who had always been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
&#8220;on the go&#8221; for the past four years. They suspected
that Campbell or some other man might have given
her an unwelcome burden, and they questioned her
in this respect, but her laughing denials nonplussed
them. Harry had an interview with Campbell, and had
grudgingly become convinced that Blanche was no
longer going out with him. The Palmer family finally
became convinced that she had really taken their objections
to heart and had decided to become a good
girl.</p>

<p>Blanche wrote feverishly in her room, every night,
with a little grammar which she had purchased to aid
her&mdash;descriptions of places which she knew, such as
cafeterias, dance halls and amusement parks. Her
anger at human beings, and her sense of humor, fought
against each other in these accounts, and the result
was frequently a curious mixture of indignations and
grimaces. Starling was ever a vision, standing in her
room and urging on her hands ... she was writing for
his sake as well as her own. If the rest of her life
was to be interwoven in his, she would have to make
herself worthy of him, and try to equal his own creations,
and give him much more than mere physical
contacts and adoring words. Otherwise, he might
become quickly tired of her!</p>

<p>Her courage grew stronger with each succeeding
night, and a youthful, though still sober, elasticity
within her began to make plans that slew her prostrate
broodings. Eric and she would simply run off to
some remote spot&mdash;Canada, Mexico, Paris, anywhere&mdash;and
then the specters and hatreds in their immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
scene would be powerless to injure or interfere
with them. What was the use of remaining and fighting,
when all of the odds were against them, and when
the other side was so stubbornly unscrupulous, so
utterly devoid of sympathy and understanding? In
such a case, they would only be throwing themselves
open to every kind of attack and intrusion, if not to
an almost certain defeat. Eric might be a &#8220;nigger,&#8221;
yes, but he certainly didn&#8217;t look like one, and he was
better than any of the white men she had ever met ...
dear, sweet boy ... and she loved him with every particle
of her heart. She was sure of that now. She had
never before felt anything remotely equal to the huge,
restless emptiness which her separation from him had
brought her&mdash;a sort of can&#8217;t-stand-it-not-to-see-him
feeling that rose within her, even when she was in the
midst of writing, and kept her pencil idly poised over
the paper for minutes, while in her fancy she teased
his hair, or chided some witticism of his. She&#8217;d go
through ten thousand hells rather than give him up!</p>

<p>After a week and a half had passed, she determined
to visit Margaret and &#8220;talk it over&#8221; with the other
girl. It wasn&#8217;t that Margaret could convince her one
way or the other&mdash;she had made her decision&mdash;but
still, she craved the possible sympathy and encouragement
of at least one other person besides Eric. It
was hard to stand so utterly alone.</p>

<p>After telephoning, and finding that Margaret would
be alone that night, she hurried down to see her.</p>

<p>The two girls sparred pleasantly and nervously with
each other for a while as though they were both dreading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
the impending subject&mdash;which Margaret had
sensed&mdash;and futilely trying to delay its appearance.
Finally, Blanche blurted out, after a silence: &#8220;I suppose
you know I&#8217;m in love with Eric Starling, Mart.
You must have guessed it, the way I fooled around
with him at Tony&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been worrying quite a bit about that,&#8221;
Margaret answered. &#8220;Do you know that he&#8217;s, well&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know that he&#8217;s a negro,&#8221; Blanche interrupted.
&#8220;It&#8217;s true, Eric has just a little negro blood
in him, but you must admit, dear, that he&#8217;s the
whitest-looking one you ever saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, he&#8217;d have fooled me, too, when I first met
him, if Max hadn&#8217;t told me about it,&#8221; Margaret said.
&#8220;I like him, too. He&#8217;s certainly not fatiguing to look
at, and he has a lovely sense of humor, but still, can
you quite forget about his negro blood when ... oh,
when you&#8217;re petting together, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I forget it?&mdash;why, I go mad, stark mad, &#8217;f he
just puts his hand over mine,&#8221; Blanche cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
never fallen so hard for any man in all my life&mdash;I mean
it, Mart. I arranged not to meet him for two weeks&mdash;just
to see &#8217;f I wouldn&#8217;t cool down about him, you
know&mdash;but it&#8217;s only convinced me all the more. I&#8217;ll
never be able to get along without him ... never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, after all, there&#8217;s no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t
have a little affair with him, if you&#8217;re careful about it,&#8221;
Margaret replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s much deeper than that,&#8221; Blanche said
slowly. &#8220;We&#8217;re both perm&#8217;nently in love with each
other, we really are. It&#8217;s a big, precious thing, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
not just ... well ... not just wanting to have a few
parties, you know. I&#8217;m going to live with him for
years and years, and maybe marry him right now.
It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve ever loved any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Blanche, you&#8217;re going to let yourself in for
an endless nightmare, if that&#8217;s the case,&#8221; Margaret replied,
sorrowfully. &#8220;Your people will simply raise the
roof off, if they&#8217;re anything like you say they are. And
then, all the other things&mdash;children, and living among
his negro friends, and getting snubbed right and left....
Are you really sure you love him enough for all
that? Are you, really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I <i>am</i> sure,&#8221; Blanche said, in a slow, sick-at-heart,
stubborn voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of everything,
don&#8217;t worry about that, and it hasn&#8217;t given me much
rest, either. Oh, how I hate this blind, mean world
of ours!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, but hating it never solves anything,&#8221;
Margaret answered, dully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to solve it by running off with him,&#8221;
Blanche continued. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go far away, to Paris or
London&mdash;some place where nobody&#8217;ll know that Eric&#8217;s
a negro, and we&#8217;ll stay there for the rest of our lives,
that&#8217;s all. I don&#8217;t care &#8217;f we both have to wash dishes
for a living, I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s all right to fight back when
you&#8217;ve got a chance, but not when everything&#8217;s against
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny, I never thought of that,&#8221; Margaret said,
more cheerfully. &#8220;It might work out that way. Of
course, it <i>is</i> cowardly in a way, but after all, there&#8217;s
little sense to being brave in the lions&#8217; den and getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
devoured. It might work out fine, if you&#8217;re both certain
your love&#8217;s going to last. Somehow or other, it&#8217;s
hard for me to believe in a permanent love. I don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;ve ever noticed it in any of the people around
me. Are you sure you&#8217;re not just in a sentimental
dream, Blanche?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blanche reflected for a while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, &#8217;f we&#8217;re both making a mistake, we&#8217;ll be
happy, anyway, till we find it out,&#8221; she said at last.
&#8220;Good Lord, &#8217;f you never take any risks in life, why
then you&#8217;ll be sad all the time, and you won&#8217;t have
any happiness at all, no matter how short it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I agree with you there,&#8221; Margaret answered,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>They fell into a discussion of the practical details
of Blanche&#8217;s possible departure, and the money that
would be required, and the difficulty of earning a living
in Europe, both trying to lose themselves in a bright
animation. When Blanche parted with Margaret, a
little after midnight, she felt more confident, and
almost light-hearted. After all, if two human beings
were wise, and brave, and forever alert, they simply
couldn&#8217;t be separated from each other, no matter what
the dangers were.</p>

<p>The mood remained with her and grew more intense
each day, and when she rang Starling&#8217;s bell at the end
of the week, she was almost fluttering with hope and
resolution. For the first hour they did little more
than remain in each other&#8217;s arms, in a daze and maze
of kisses, sighs, and simple, reiterated love words. To
Starling, huge violins and cornets were ravishing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
air of the room, and the street sounds outside, floating
in through an open window, were only the applause of
an unseen audience. After all, only times like this gave
human beings any possible excuse for existing&mdash;the
rest of life was simply a series of strugglings, and dodgings,
and tantalizings, and defeats. The least pressure
of her fingertips provoked a fiery somersault within
him, and the grazing of her bosom and face against his
aroused revolving conflagrations within his breast.
Blanche had become a stunned child, scarcely daring
to believe in the compensations which were ruffling her
blood to something more than music, and yet desperately
guarding them, incoherently whispering over
them, endlessly testing them with her fingers and lips,
lest they prove to be the cruellest of fantasies.</p>

<p>When Blanche and Starling had made a moderate return
to a rational condition, they began to discuss their
future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that we must run away, Eric, dear?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just be crushed and beaten down,
otherwise. My brother Harry, he&#8217;d never rest till he&#8217;d
put you in a hospital&mdash;oh, but don&#8217;t I know him&mdash;and
he might even try to do worse. I get the shivers when
I think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her words were an affront to his courage, and he
said: &#8220;Listen, I can take care of myself&mdash;I&#8217;ve been
through a pretty tough mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you can, but they wouldn&#8217;t fight fair,&#8221;
she answered, impatiently. &#8220;They&#8217;d just proceed to
get you by hook or crook. And that&#8217;s not half of it.
Why, I can just see ev&#8217;rybody turning their backs on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
us, &#8217;r making nasty remarks, &#8217;r trying to poison us
against each other. We&#8217;ve just got to run away and
live where nobody knows us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it would be too yellow,&#8221; he replied, stubbornly.
&#8220;All the things you mention will only be a test of our
love for each other. If we can&#8217;t stand the gaff, then
our love isn&#8217;t what we thought it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;d go through
anything with you &#8217;f I thought it was the best thing
we could do, but why should we stay here and run
up against all kinds of suff&#8217;rings and insults, and
dangers, too, just to show how darn brave we are?
It&#8217;s not cowardly to run off when everything&#8217;s against
us&mdash;it&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s think it over for another week, anyway,&#8221;
he answered, slowly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to slink away, with
my tail between my legs, but maybe it&#8217;s the only thing
to do. If we were only starting a little affair, like most
of the mixed couples that hang out at Vanderin&#8217;s shack,
then it would be different, of course, but we&#8217;re probably
facing a whole lifetime together, and it&#8217;s a much
more serious matter. The trouble is I&#8217;ve a great deal
of pride in me, honey, and it always wants to fight
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have, too,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but in a time like this
it&#8217;s just foolish to be so proud&mdash;it&#8217;ll only help other
people to make us unhappy, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent for a while, and then he said,
with a smile: &#8220;Good Lord, we&#8217;re getting morbid and
theatrical. The whole thing may not be half as bad as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
we think it is. Anyway, let&#8217;s forget it for one night,
at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>They spent the remainder of the evening in an
idyllic way. He read her his sensuous, symbolistic
poems, and talked about them, and told her exciting
stories of his past life, while she tried to describe some
of the struggles and hesitations which had attended the
birth of her mind, and her search for happiness in the
face of sordid punches, and stupid jeers, and all the
disappointments with which ignorance slays itself.
They resolved not to become complete lovers until
they were really living together and removed from
fears and uncertainties. When they parted at 2 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>
they were both wrapped up in a warmly exhausted but
plotting trance. They arranged to meet on the following
Wednesday, at Tony&#8217;s Club, and Blanche felt
feathery and on tiptoes, as she rode back to the uninviting
home which she would soon leave forever.</p>

<p>The next four days were excruciating centuries to
her, and she was barely able to stagger through the
nagging, drab details of her work at Madame Jaurette&#8217;s.
She spent her nights writing in her room, and
the even trend of her days remained uninvaded until
Tuesday evening, when she found a letter waiting for
her at home. It was from Oppendorf, who told her that
he had polished up her account of the Vanderin party
and had sold it to a New York magazine of the jaunty,
trying-hard-to-be-sophisticated kind. She was overjoyed
as she stared at the fifty-dollar check which
he had enclosed, and she could scarcely wait to tell
the news to Eric. Now she had proved her mettle, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
was on the road to becoming a creative equal of his&mdash;blissful
thought.</p>

<p>When she met him at Tony&#8217;s, she gayly extracted the
check from her purse and waved it in front of his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what do you think of your stupid, hair-curling
Blanche?&#8221; she asked elatedly.</p>

<p>He laughed at her excitement as he led her to a
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t made me believe in your ability just
because you&#8217;ve been accepted by a frothy, snippy magazine,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I knew all about it the first night I
met you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, this means I&#8217;m going to make a name
for myself,&#8221; she answered, proudly.</p>

<p>He gave her a fatherly smile&mdash;what a delicious combination
of na&iuml;vet&eacute;s and instinctive wisdoms she was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt the same way when I first broke into print,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The excitement dies down after a while, and
then you don&#8217;t care so much whether people like your
stuff or not. You get down to a grimly plodding gait,
old dear, and you start to write only for yourself.
Then each acceptance means only so many dollars and
cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>She retorted merrily: &#8220;Wet ra-ag&mdash;don&#8217;t try to
dampen my spirits. It can&#8217;t be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brazenly sensual clatter and uproar of Tony&#8217;s
pounded against their minds, and even Starling, more
skeptically inured to it, and knowing every hidden,
sordid wrinkle in the place, became more flighty and
swaggering as he danced with Blanche. It meant something,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
now that the girl whom he really loved was
stepping out beside him, and it had become something
less gross than a collection of rounders, sulky or giggling
white and colored flappers, fast women, and
hoodwinked sugar-papas spending their rolls to impress
the women beside them. Now it was an appropriate
carnival-accompaniment to his happiness.</p>

<p>Immersed in Starling, Blanche did not notice the
group of newcomers who had seated themselves two
tables behind her. They consisted of her brother
Harry, another wooden-faced, overdressed man of
middle age, and their thickly painted, sullen-eyed ladies
of the evening. Harry was settling the details of a
whisky-transaction with Jack Compton, the other man.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have the cases there by midnight on the dot,&#8221;
he said, in a low voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a cop fixed up, an&#8217;
he&#8217;s gonna stand guard for us an&#8217; say it&#8217;s K.O., &#8217;f any
one tries to butt in. We&#8217;ll have to hand him a century,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right with me,&#8221; Compton replied. &#8220;You
put this deal through without slipping up and there&#8217;ll
be a coupla hundred in it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as good as done,&#8221; Harry answered, with a heavy
nod.</p>

<p>Then, glancing around, he spied Blanche at the other
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, there&#8217;s my crazy sis, Blanche,&#8221; he said, pointing
to her. &#8220;In the red pleated skirt, two tables down
by the railing. See her, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh ... she&#8217;s a good looker, Harry,&#8221; Compton replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>&#8220;Say, I know the fellow with her,&#8221; one of the woman
broke in. &#8220;He works here&mdash;he&#8217;s public&#8217;ty-man for the
joint. Name&#8217;s Starling&mdash;Eric Starling. I met him down
here about a week ago. What&#8217;s your sister doing out
with a nigger, Harry? She seems to be mighty thick
with him from the way she&#8217;s cutting up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go o-on, he looks damn white to me,&#8221; Harry answered,
intently scowling toward the other table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he <i>is</i> a nigger just the same,&#8221; the second
woman said. &#8220;It&#8217;s known all around here&mdash;he don&#8217;t
deny it any. I&#8217;ve seen them like him before. They&#8217;re
only about one-eighth black, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t your sister get any white fellows to go around
with?&#8221; Compton asked. &#8220;She must be hard up, trotting
around with a shine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, she&#8217;s sure crazy about dark meat, I&#8217;ll say,&#8221;
the first woman commented, with a laugh.</p>

<p>The taunts pierced Harry&#8217;s thick skin, and a rage
grew within him. He&#8217;d stood for her going with Jews,
and wops, and dopey weak-sisters, but a nigger was too
much! It affronted his family-pride and erectness, and
made him feel that his friends had been given a chance
to ridicule him in an indirect way. For all he knew,
Blanche might be having intimate relations with this
coon, or might be even fixing to marry him. The
thought was like a red-hot iron. His own sister, acting
like a slut, in a black-and-tan dive, and consorting with
a nigger there, or maybe with more of them.... By
God, he wouldn&#8217;t stand for that!</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m gonna go over an&#8217; bust him in the nose,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
said, half rising from his chair. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be leavin&#8217; white
girls alone after I&#8217;m through with him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Compton pulled Harry back to his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your shirt on, d&#8217;you hear me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
you start a scrap here you won&#8217;t have a chance&mdash;every
bouncer &#8217;n&#8217; waiter in the place&#8217;ll be right on top of you.
I&#8217;ve seen them in action before, and believe me, they
work just like a machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can get in a coupla good cracks at him before
they throw me out,&#8221; Harry persisted. &#8220;I want to show
that dirty shine where <i>he</i> gets off at, makin&#8217; a play for
a sister uh mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t show him this way,&#8221; Compton retorted.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll land in the hospital, and you&#8217;ll land there quick,
too. This gang down here don&#8217;t like a white man&#8217;s
looks anyway, and they&#8217;ll give you the leather, just for
good luck. Come on, let&#8217;s all clear outa here. You
can lay for him to-morrow night, if you want to, &#8217;r
else give your sister a good bawling out when you get
her home, an&#8217; make her stay away from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they can&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; &#8217;f I go over an&#8217; bawl
her out now,&#8221; Harry said, with a drunken stubbornness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, keep your head, Harry, we don&#8217;t want to get
the girl-friends here into no trouble,&#8221; Compton replied.
&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s beat it, Harry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The women added their persuasions, and Harry
finally gave a reluctant assent. He departed with his
friends, after vowing to settle the matter during the
next few days.</p>

<p>Blanche and Starling continued their entranced capers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
until the closing hour, and when they rode to her
home, they were steeped in a tired and lazy fondness,
with their arms around each other and their heads
close together. The apparitions and doubts had disappeared
from their situation, as far as they were concerned,
and nothing remained but a deliciously overheated
and rumpled nearness to each other. They arranged
to meet on the following Saturday night, and
exchanged several farewell kisses, in the cab, before
they reluctantly parted.</p>

<p>Blanche slept until noon, since the day was a holiday&mdash;Memorial
Day&mdash;and when she awoke, the other Palmers
were eating a late breakfast around the kitchen
table. As she entered the kitchen, in her kimono,
the family turned and surveyed her, each bearing a
frown on his face. Taken aback, and suddenly prodded
by an instinctive fear, Blanche advanced slowly toward
the table. How could they know anything about
Starling&mdash;nonsense. They were probably &#8220;sore&#8221; at
her for some other reasons.</p>

<p>After she had seated herself at the table, the bombardment
commenced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was you with last night?&#8221; Harry asked, with
a sneer, to see whether she would lie.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s none of <i>your</i> business,&#8221; Blanche replied, coolly,
her fears soothed now.</p>

<p>&#8220;We-ell, that&#8217;s a hot one&mdash;going around with a nigger
is none of our business, huh?&#8221; Mabel queried, in a
shrill voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Blanche asked, mechanically&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
blow had come, just when she had least expected
it!</p>

<p>She became sick at heart, and dreaded the impending
assault, and scarcely knew what she could answer.
If she became defiant, it would only enrage them all
the more, and it would be useless, besides ... what
could she do, oh, what? To attempt to explain matters
to her family would be ridiculous.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what we mean all right,&#8221; her father
cried. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been goin&#8217; out with a shine&mdash;Harry
saw you together last night down at Tony&#8217;s Club. For
all we know you may be hooked up with him in the
bargain. &#8217;F I was sure of it, by God, I swear I&#8217;d take
a swing at you, daughter &#8217;r no daughter!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blanche remained silent&mdash;what they said to her
didn&#8217;t matter, and she wasn&#8217;t afraid of them, but Eric,
Eric ... they might kill him, or cripple him for life.
They were really aroused now as they had never been
before&mdash;she knew them well enough to tell when they
were merely blustering and when not&mdash;and they felt
that she was on the verge of disgracing and insulting
everything that supported their lives&mdash;the cruelly
proud, angry delusion of blood superiority, which they
clung to as a last resort against all of the submissions
and lacks in their existences. In their opinion, Eric was
little better than a rat, who had tried to break into the
sacred family kitchen.</p>

<p>Her mother began to speak, through fits of weeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Blanie, Blanie, what&#8217;s come over you? You
must be outa your head, you must. You&#8217;ve just got to
give up that nigger you&#8217;re goin&#8217; with, &#8217;r you&#8217;ll be breakin&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
my heart.... Blanie, Blanie, promise your ma
you&#8217;ll never give yourself to nobody but a white man
... promise me, Blanie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See what you&#8217;re doing to ma,&#8221; Mabel said. &#8220;You&#8217;re
just bringing her to her grave, that&#8217;s what!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m gonna take a hand in this,&#8221; her father
cried. &#8220;You&#8217;ll stay away from that fellow from now
on, &#8217;r I&#8217;ll land in jail f&#8217;r manslaughter. I&#8217;m not kiddin&#8217;
any this time. You&#8217;ve been havin&#8217; your own way, an&#8217;
stickin&#8217; up your nose at us, an&#8217; we&#8217;ve let you get away
with it, but you never put over anythin&#8217; like this&mdash;hookin&#8217;
up with a lousy nigger! What have you got to
say f&#8217;r yourself, huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, that&#8217;s what I wanta know,&#8221; Harry said, as he
glowered at her.</p>

<p>The promptings of cunning began to stir in Blanche&#8217;s
brain. To save Eric, she would have to lie, abasing,
tricky lies. No other answers were possible. If she
strove to argue with her family now, or if she showed
a hairbreadth of independence, they would instantly
seek Eric out, and even his life might be in danger.
She was certain of that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only gone out with him twice,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know he was a negro, I swear I didn&#8217;t. I only
found it out last night, just before I left him. He told
me he was then, and I was good and mad about it. I
called him down for daring to make up to me, and I
told him I&#8217;d never, never see him again. He looks just
like a white man, and he&#8217;d fool almost anybody. I
swear he would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bla-anie, I mighta known it was somethin&#8217; like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
this,&#8221; her mother cried, joyously. &#8220;&#8217;Course you won&#8217;t
see him no more, now you&#8217;ve found out, &#8217;course you
won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; Blanche answered, vigorously.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not picking out negroes this year, unless I don&#8217;t
know what they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blanche hated herself for the groveling words which
she forced from her mouth, and yet she felt that she
had given the only shrewd answer that could possibly
placate the stupid viciousness assailing her. She&#8217;d be
willing to become a carpet, for Eric&#8217;s sake, any day in
the year, no matter what nausea might be attached to
the proceeding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all right then, we&#8217;ll let it rest,&#8221; her father
said, in a growling voice; &#8220;but just the same, Harry an&#8217;
me&#8217;ll keep a close watch on you. &#8217;F you&#8217;re not tellin&#8217;
us a straight story, it&#8217;ll be bad for this Starling guy.
We&#8217;ll put him in a nice, tight hotel, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you there,&#8221; Harry broke in. &#8220;What I&#8217;d
like to know is why she didn&#8217;t speak up when we
started to ask her about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, you were all on top of me like a ton of bricks,&#8221;
Blanche answered. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a chance to say anything.
Besides, I was ashamed of the whole thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I can understand that,&#8221; Philip said, eagerly,
glad that his favorite sister had not been intending
to disgrace them after all. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Harry say this
morning that it was hard to tell this Starlun guy from
a white fellow? Blanche was just taken in, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course she was,&#8221; Mrs. Palmer affirmed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not sayin&#8217; she wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; her father replied.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll just keep tabs on her, anyway, an&#8217; make sure
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blanche continued her meek explanations and protests
of innocence, and her family gradually calmed
down and resumed a surface quietness. She knew that
the suspicions of her father and Harry were still
smoldering, and that these two would probably shadow
her for some time, or use some other means to become
cognizant of her nightly destinations and companions.
She noticed also the speculative looks that Mabel gave
her now and then. Mabel was too expert a liar not to
doubt her sister&#8217;s tale, and she determined to do a little
&#8220;snooping around&#8221; herself. You never can tell about
Blanche.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day and night held a nightmare
to Blanche. She had to affect a nonchalant mien&mdash;they
would doubt her again if she showed any sadness
or depression&mdash;and the strain was infinite, like holding
up a boulder. Visions of Eric&#8217;s lifeless body dodged in
and out of her mind and made her shiver helplessly.
Harry and his gangsters could &#8220;get&#8221; poor Eric without
half trying, and it would be useless to attempt to flee
with him now, since she would be under the severest
of scrutinies, where any false move might bring misfortune.
Still, wasn&#8217;t there another way out of it?
Why couldn&#8217;t they remain scrupulously apart from
each other for half a year, or even longer, and then,
when all of the suspicions and spyings had completely
vanished, suddenly run away together? By that time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
her family would certainly have forgotten the matter,
and in the interim, she could go about with other men&mdash;somehow
compelling herself&mdash;and outwardly maintain
her normal ways. A wan approach to cheerfulness possessed
her, and late that night, she sat up in bed and
wrote to Eric:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">My Dearest Boy</span>:</p>

<p>My brother Harry saw us at Tony&#8217;s last night, and
this morning they gave me hell. It was no use to argue
with them and make them even nastier&mdash;just no use.
They said they would kill you, dearest, and I know
they were not fourflushing when they said it. They&#8217;re
cruel and stupid, and to their way of thinking, I&#8217;d
disgrace and humiliate them if I ever married you.
It&#8217;s what they cling to when everything else shows them
how small they are&mdash;this snarling, keep-off pride in
being white.... I lied to them and said I hadn&#8217;t known
that you were colored, and swore I&#8217;d never see you
again. Please, please forgive me, Eric. They&#8217;d have
killed you if I hadn&#8217;t lied. And please, Eric, you must
do as I say. This is the plan I have. We won&#8217;t see
each other for exactly six months, and then we&#8217;ll suddenly
run away together. Everything will be quiet
then, and before they know what&#8217;s happened, we&#8217;ll be
hundreds of miles away. If we tried it now we wouldn&#8217;t
have a chance. Please, dearest boy, write and tell me
you&#8217;ll do as I say. I love you more than anything
else in life, and you&#8217;re like a prince walking through
some rose-bushes, and you fill all of my heart, and I&#8217;ll
never give you up&mdash;never be afraid of that. Answer me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
at once and address the letter to Madame Jaurette&#8217;s.
I&#8217;m sending you a thousand kisses, dearest boy.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span></p>
</div>

<p>After finishing the letter, she felt woebegonely relieved
and slightly hopeful, and the mood stayed with
her through the following day of work at the Beauty
Shop. She had placed a special-delivery stamp on the
letter, and he received it in a few hours. After he
had read and reread it several times, with a touch
of anger lurking in his numbness, he began to pace up
and down in his room, as though striving to goad himself
into life again. Was she really giving him up, and
trying to hide the blow with promises of a future
escape? Was she?... No, Blanche was too inhumanly
honest for that&mdash;even if she had wanted to lie, she
could never have induced herself to put the words on
paper. If he were wrong in this belief, then he would
lose all of his faith in his ability to peer into human
beings, and would call himself a fool for the remainder
of his life! Somehow, a tremor of simple sincerity
seemed to run through her letter&mdash;he couldn&#8217;t be
mistaken.</p>

<p>Well, what then? If he persisted in running off with
Blanche now, it might lead to melodrama. White
gangsters such as her brother would not hesitate about
attempting to &#8220;croak him off.&#8221; He wasn&#8217;t afraid of
actually fighting them, but any man was always defenseless
against a sudden bullet or knife-thrust, and
he certainly didn&#8217;t care to die that way. B-r-r, the
thought brought a fine sweat to his temples. No, these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
whites were little better than rodents, when their angry
pride was aroused, and you had to use some of their
own tactics, or perish.</p>

<p>They regarded him as a dirty nigger, these lily-pure,
intelligent, lofty, noble-hearted people. What a nauseating
joke! But, joke or no joke, it had to be grappled
with. Blanche was right after all&mdash;when you were
in a trap you had to gnaw slyly at the things binding
you. It was galling to your erect defiance to admit it,
but often, in a dire crisis, an imbecilic bravery brought
you no gain, and caused your extinction. Yes, Blanche
was right&mdash;it would be best for them to separate for
half a year and then take the other side by surprise,
with a thumb-twiddling swiftness. They would have to
be patient&mdash;splendidly, grimly, bitterly patient&mdash;and
somehow control the aches and cries in their hearts.</p>

<p>Of course, during the coming months, he would go
out with women now and then, or chat with them&mdash;as
a feeble diversion&mdash;but he would shun any intimate
relations with them, if it were humanly possible. A
pretty, well-shaped girl could always affect a man, in
a purely physical way&mdash;he wasn&#8217;t trying naively to
delude himself on <i>that</i> score&mdash;but just the same he
intended to try his damnedest to remain faithful to
Blanche. She invaded and stirred him as no other
woman had, and if he consorted with other girls now,
it would be a taunting and unanswerable aspersion
against the depth and uniqueness of his love for her. In
such a case he would be forced to admit that all of
love was only an easily incited lust&mdash;but it wasn&#8217;t
true. He <i>would</i> remain faithful to her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>He sat down and wrote a hopeful, agreeing letter,
expressing his implicit belief in her, and swearing that
he would remain true, and urging her to emulate his
jaunty fortitude.</p>

<p>When she received the letter on the following afternoon,
a surge of youthful determination almost drove
the darkness out of her heart. If he had written morbidly,
or in despair, her tottering and beleaguered
feelings would have been crushed, but now she felt
armored and half-way restored to her former happiness.
After all, they were both very young, and six
months now were little more than six hours in <i>their</i>
lives.</p>

<p>During the next month she went to cabarets and
theaters with other men, and wearily repulsed their
inevitable attempts to embrace her afterwards, and
preserved a careful attitude toward her family&mdash;not
too friendly and not too ill-tempered. They would
have suspected her of playing a part if she had suddenly
seemed to become too pliable and harmonious.
She saw Margaret and Oppendorf once, but did not
tell them anything concerning the developments in her
relations with Eric. She feared that they would advise
her never to see him again, and she didn&#8217;t care to pass
through the futile torments of an argument. She had
made up her mind, and no human being could change it.</p>

<p>When a month had passed, however, a restlessly
jealous mood stole imperceptibly over her. Perhaps
Eric was running about with other girls now; perhaps
his head was pressed against the smooth tenderness
of their bosoms, or perhaps he had found another girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
far more beautiful and intelligent than any Blanche
Palmer. The mood reached a climax one Sunday afternoon,
as she boarded an &#8220;L&#8221; train and rode down to
the Battery. Yes, of course, he must have forgotten
her by now. He met tens of women every night down
at Tony&#8217;s, and among all of them it would be easy for
him to find a quick-minded, tempting girl&mdash;perhaps
one of his own race, who would not lead him into
staggering troubles and difficulties.</p>

<p>She sat on a bench facing the greenish-gray swells
of dirty water, and watched the bobbing boats, and the
laboriously swaying barges, and the straining, smoky
tugs. A mood of plaintive, barely wounded peace settled
about her, in spite of the jealous ranklings underneath.
For an hour she sat draped in this acceptant
revery, with her mind scarcely stirring. Then, glancing
up, she saw that Eric was standing beside her.</p>

<p>For almost half a minute they stared at each other,
without shifting their positions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eric ... darling ... what are you doing here?&#8221;
she asked at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never dreamt I&#8217;d see you,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I was
walking along and trying to forget my blues when I
caught sight of you. I tried hard to turn around then
and avoid you, but I just couldn&#8217;t do it. I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you didn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, as he sat down
beside her. &#8220;Eric, my boysie, what&#8217;s been happening
to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been plodding along, and writing poems to
you, and extolling the barbaric charms of Tony&#8217;s,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;I&#8217;d get worried and hopeless every now and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
then, thinking you were in some other man&#8217;s arms ...
just like a boy who doesn&#8217;t know whether he&#8217;s going
to be whipped or petted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly how I felt,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Why, say,
I had you falling in love with every snippy, doll-faced
girl in New York!&#8221;</p>

<p>They laughed&mdash;softly, ruefully, and with a relaxing
weariness.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about your exquisite people?&#8221; he asked, after
a pause. &#8220;Do they still keep a close watch on you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think they&#8217;re completely deceived by now,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve played a foxy game, you know&mdash;going
out with other men, and bragging about them, and
hiding my feelings all the time. I was so afraid that
somebody you know would see me with some fellow
and tell you about it. I just couldn&#8217;t help it, darling.
One little break might have given me away, and I
just had to fool my folks. There wasn&#8217;t any other
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I understand,&#8221; he replied, as he stroked her
hand and looked at her with the expression of a man
relievedly twitting his past fears and pains.</p>

<p>They were silent for a while, reveling in the unexpected,
warm nearness to each other and feeling a
giddy swirl of revived faiths and hopes. Their first
little rush of reassuring words had aroused all of the
deferred plans and buried braveries within them, but
the awakening was not yet articulate enough for spoken
syllables. They longed to embrace each other with
an open intensity, and the effort needed to control this
desire also served to prevent them from talking. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
Blanche remembered a fear which she had experienced
during the previous week.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eric, did you ever see a play called &#8216;God&#8217;s People
Got Wings?&#8217;&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I&#8217;ve heard about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it certainly made me shiver,&#8221; she said. &#8220;One
of Oppendorf&#8217;s friends took me down to see it, and
I&#8217;ve never had such a dreadful time in my life. It was
all about a colored man marrying a white girl. It ended
up with the colored boy killing his wife and then committing
suicide&mdash;think of it!&mdash;and I was just gripping
the sides of my seat all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you afraid it might have some connection
with us?&#8221; he asked, gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, of course not,&#8221; she answered, as she
clutched his hand. &#8220;D&#8217;you think I&#8217;m silly enough to
let some prejudiced man tell me whether I&#8217;m going to
be happy or not? No, Eric, it wasn&#8217;t that, but I did
feel angry and upset, and, we-ell ... it set me to
wondering. Why do all these writers now always insist
that colored and white people weren&#8217;t meant to get
along with each other&mdash;oh, why do they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister Shakespeare revived it with his Othello and
it&#8217;s been going strong ever since,&#8221; he replied, with a
contention of forlorn and contemptuous inflections in
his voice. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be argued about. Most of them
are perfectly sincere, and they really believe that people
of different races always hate and fear each other
at the bottom. You could get yourself blue in the face
telling them exceptional men and women aren&#8217;t included<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
in this rule, but it wouldn&#8217;t make the slightest impression.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why are they so stubborn about it?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; he answered, wearily. &#8220;They don&#8217;t
want to admit that there&#8217;s the smallest possibility of
the races ever coming together. It&#8217;s a deep, blind
pride, and they simply can&#8217;t get rid of it. They&#8217;re
hardly ever conscious of it, Blanche, but it&#8217;s there
just the same. Why, even Vanderin isn&#8217;t free from it.
Take that latest book of his&mdash;Black Paradise&mdash;and
what do you find? What? He&#8217;s just a bystander trying
to be indulgent and sympathetic. It&#8217;s the old
story. Negroes are primitive and sa-avage at the bottom,
and white people aren&#8217;t ... white people like
your brother, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been unable to restrain the sarcasm of his
last words because his wounds had cried out for a
childish relief. She had listened to him with a fascination
that was near to worship ... what a dear, wise,
eloquent boy he was! When he talked, even the ghosts
of her former specters fled from her heart. Let the
world call him a nigger&mdash;what did it matter? They
didn&#8217;t care whether he was beautiful or not&mdash;all they
wanted was to &#8220;keep him in his place,&#8221; these in-tel-li-gent
people, just because he happened to have a mixture
of blood within him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s not talk any more about it,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;We&#8217;re in love with each other, Eric, boysie, and ...
&#8217;f other people don&#8217; like it they can stand on their
heads, for all I care!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>He fondled her shoulder, gratefully, and an uproar
was in his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blanche, what&#8217;s the use of waiting and waiting?&#8221;
he asked at last. &#8220;We&#8217;re only suffering and denying
ourselves when there&#8217;s no reason for it. Let&#8217;s run off
to-morrow and marry each other. If we wait too long
we&#8217;ll feel too helpless about it&mdash;it&#8217;ll grow to be a
habit with us. I can&#8217;t exist any longer without you,
Blanche&mdash;it&#8217;s just impossible ... impossible. I&#8217;ll
draw out the thousand I have in the bank and we&#8217;ll
hop a train for Chicago to-morrow afternoon. Don&#8217;t
you see it&#8217;s useless to keep postponing it, Blanche?&#8221;</p>

<p>His eagerness, and her longing for him, expelled the
last vestige of her fears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, I&#8217;ll go with you to-morrow,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Their hands gripped each other with the power of
iron bands, and they stared hopefully out across the
greenish-gray swells of water.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
